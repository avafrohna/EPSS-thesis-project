## Scrapers
### Reddit

### HackerNews
The scraper works, unfortunately there is currently not much data as very few posts actually contain CVEs. Currently data is stored in a JSON file.

### ExploitDB
The scraper works. Every entry has a CVE, some days there are quite a few, but some days there are no posts. Posts are stored in a JSON file.

### Bleeping Computer

### The Record

### Stack Overflow

### Mastedon

### Telegram

### Discord
We decided not to use discord due to a variety of issues with servers allowing scraping.
