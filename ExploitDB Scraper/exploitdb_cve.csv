# NB: Python's built-in `zipfile` module has limitations on the `arcname` parameter. 
# To bypass this restriction, edit the module's source code (`zipfile.py`) and comment out the following line:
# arcname = os.path.normpath(os.path.splitdrive(arcname)[1])
# For a more detailed explanation, feel free to check out my blog post here: https://themcsam.github.io/posts/unzip-stream-PoC/

zip_name = 'evil.zip'

Microsoft - NTLM Hash Disclosure Spoofing (library-ms),2025-05-01,https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/52280,2025-24054,"{""2025-24054"": 1}","# Exploit title: Microsoft - NTLM Hash Disclosure Spoofing (library-ms)

Back in 2018, I reported a "".library-ms"" File NTLM information disclosure vulnerability to MSRC and was told ""it was not severe enough"", that being said I post it anyways.
Seven years passed, until other researchers re-reported it.

Subsequently this security flaw was finally deemed important by Microsoft and it received CVE-2025-24054, for which I was finally retroactively credited as the original reporter.
