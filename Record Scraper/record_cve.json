The flaw, confirmed and patched by ESET, allowed malware to run undetected on targeted systems. The attackers used a tool called TCDSB based on EDRSandBlast, enabling stealth execution and defense evasion. Although ESET said it had not observed active exploitation, the campaign highlights risks even from security tools when leveraged by advanced actors.",
