The suspect, Rami Khaled Ahmed, is accused of deploying the Black Kingdom malware on roughly 1,500 computers in the United States and abroad, demanding ransom payments of $10,000 in Bitcoin. ""According to the indictment, from March 2021 to June 2023, Ahmed and others infected computer networks of several U.S.-based victims, including a medical billing services company in Encino, a ski resort in Oregon, a school district in Pennsylvania, and a health clinic in Wisconsin,""explains a U.S. Department of Justice announcement. ""When the malware was successful, the ransomware then created a ransom note on the victim's system that directed the victim to send $10,000 worth of Bitcoin to a cryptocurrency address controlled by a co-conspirator and to send proof of this payment to a Black Kingdom email address,"" reads another part of the announcement. The U.S. DoJ highlights that Ahmed designed Black Kingdom ransomware to exploit a vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange for initial access to targeted computers. This was first reported in March 2021 by researcherMarcus Hutchins, who discovered web shells deployed by Black Kingdom ransomware operators on Exchange servers vulnerable to ProxyLogon attacks. TheProxyLogonflaw refers to a set of critical vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server that were first disclosed and exploited in early 2021. The flaws are CVE-2021-26855 (Server-Side Request Forgery used for initial access), CVE-2021-26857 (insecure deserialization used for privilege escalation to SYSTEM), and CVE-2021-26858 and CVE-2021-27065 (arbitrary file write used for writing web shells to servers). Soon, Microsoft confirmed that Black Kingdom hadcompromised 1,500 Exchange serversby leveraging ProxyLogon flaws. In June 2020, it was revealed that Black Kingdomtargeted CVE-2019-11510, a critical vulnerability affecting Pulse Secure VPN, to breach corporate networks and deploy their file lockers. For his Black Kingdom attacks, Ahmed now faces charges of conspiracy, intentional damage to a protected computer, and threatening damage to a protected computer. If convicted, Ahmed faces a statutory maximum sentence of five years in federal prison for each count, totaling up to 15 years. The U.S. DoJ states that Ahmed is believed to be residing in Yemen.

On Tuesday, SonicWall updated security advisories for theCVE-2023-44221andCVE-2024-38475security flaws to tag the two vulnerabilities as ""potentially being exploited in the wild."" CVE-2023-44221 is described as a high-severity command injection vulnerability caused by improper neutralization of special elements in the SMA100 SSL-VPN management interface that enables attackers with admin privileges to inject arbitrary commands as a 'nobody' user. The second security bug, CVE-2024-38475, is rated as a critical severity flaw caused by improper escaping of output in mod_rewrite in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and earlier. Successful exploitation can allow unauthenticated, remote attackers to gain code execution by mapping URLs to file system locations permitted to be served by the server. The two vulnerabilities impact SMA 200, SMA 210, SMA 400, SMA 410, and SMA 500v devices and are patched in firmware version 10.2.1.14-75sv and later.

Listed on NASDAQ since March 2006, Commvault is included in the S&P MidCap 400 Index and provides cyber resilience services to over 100,000 organizations. As the companyfirst revealed on March 7, 2025, Commvault discovered the incident after being notified by Microsoft on February 20 of suspicious activity within its Azure environment. A follow-up investigation into the breach found that the incident only affected a small number of Commvault customers and had not impacted the company's operations. ""Importantly, there has been no unauthorized access to customer backup data that Commvault stores and protects, and no material impact on our business operations or our ability to deliver products and services,"" Danielle Sheer, the company's Chief Trust Officer,said in a Wednesday update. ""We are working closely with two leading cybersecurity firms and are coordinating with the appropriate authorities, including the FBI, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and others."" In asupport documentcontaining indicators of compromise, Commvault advises customers to apply a Conditional Access policy to all Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and Azure AD single-tenant App registrations to protect their data against similar attack attempts. It also recommended to regularly monitor sign-in activity to detect access attempts originating from IP addresses outside of allowed ranges and to rotate and sync client secrets between Commvault and the Azure portal every 90 days. ""This can help quickly identify potential security breaches or account compromises. If any unauthorized access is detected, immediately report the incident to Commvault Support for further investigation and remediation,"" the company says. The company also noted in the original disclosure that the threat actors exploited a now-patched zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2025-3928) in its Commvault Web Server software that remote authenticated attackers with low privileges can exploit remotely to plant webshells on target servers. CISA has alsoadded the CVE-2025-3928 vulnerabilityto its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog on Monday, requiring federal agencies to secure their Commvault software by May 19, 2025, as mandated by the Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01 issued in November 2021.

According to cybersecurity company Oligo Security security researchers who discovered and reported the flaws, they can be exploited in zero-click and one-click RCE attacks, man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, and denial of service (DoS) attacks, as well as to bypass access control list (ACL) and user interaction, to gain access to sensitive information, and read arbitrary local files. In all, Oligo disclosed 23 security vulnerabilities to Apple, which released security updates to address these vulnerabilities (collectively known as ""AirBorne"") on March 31 for iPhones and iPads (iOS 18.4 and iPadOS 18.4), Macs (macOS Ventura 13.7.5,macOS Sonoma 14.7.5, andmacOS Sequoia 15.4), and Apple Vision Pro (visionOS 2.4) devices. The company also patched theAirPlay audio SDK, theAirPlay video SDK, and theCarPlay Communication Plug-in. While the AirBorne vulnerabilities can only be exploited by attackers on the same network via wireless networks or peer-to-peer connections, they allow taking over vulnerable devices and using the access as a launchpad to compromise other AirPlay-enabled devices on the same network. Oligo's security researchers said they were able to demonstrate that attackers can use two of the security flaws (CVE-2025-24252 and CVE-2025-24132) to create wormable zero-click RCE exploits. Additionally, the CVE-2025-24206 user interaction bypass flaw enables a threat actor to bypass ""Accept"" click requirements on AirPlay requests and can be chained with other flaws to launch zero-click attacks. ""This means that an attacker can take over certain AirPlay-enabled devices and do things like deploy malware that spreads to devices on any local network the infected device connects to. This could lead to the delivery of other sophisticated attacks related to espionage, ransomware, supply-chain attacks, and more,""Oligo warned. ""Because AirPlay is a fundamental piece of software for Apple devices (Mac, iPhone, iPad, AppleTV, etc.) as well as third-party devices that leverage the AirPlay SDK, this class of vulnerabilities could have far-reaching impacts."" The cybersecurity company advises organizations to immediately update any corporate Apple devices and AirPlay-enabled devices to the latest software release and ask employees to also update all their personal AirPlay devices. Additional measures users can take to reduce the attack surface include updating all their Apple devices to the latest version, disabling the AirPlay receiver if not used, restricting AirPlay access to trusted devices using firewall rules, and reducing the attack surface by only allowing AirPlay for the current user. Apple says that there areover 2.35 billion active Apple devicesaround the world (including iPhones, iPads, Macs, and others), and Oligo estimates that there are also tens of millions of third-party audio devices like speakers and TVs with AirPlay support, not including car infotainment systems with CarPlay support.

SAP NetWeaver is an application server and development platform that runs and connects SAP and non-SAP applications across different technologies. Last week, SAP disclosed an unauthenticated file upload vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-31324, in SAP NetWeaver Visual Composer, specifically the Metadata Uploader component. The flaw allows remote attackers to upload arbitrary executable files on exposed instances without authenticating, achieving code execution and full system compromise. Multiple cybersecurity firms, including ReliaQuest, watchTowr, and Onapsis, confirmed the flaw isactively exploited in attacks, with threat actors utilizing it to drop web shells on vulnerable servers. A SAP spokesperson told BleepingComputer that they were aware of these attempts and released a workaround on April 8, 2024, followed by a security update that addressed CVE-2025-31324 on April 25. SAP told BleepingComputer that they are not aware of any cases where these attacks impacted customer data or systems. Researchers have now confirmed that many vulnerable SAP Netweaver servers are exposed on the internet, making them prime targets for attacks. TheShadowserver Foundationfound the427 exposed servers, warning of the massive exposed attack surface and the potentially severe repercussions of exploitation. Most of the vulnerable systems (149) are in the United States, followed by India (50), Australia (37), China (31), Germany (30), the Netherlands (13), Brazil (10), and France (10). However, cyber defense search engineOnyphepaints a more dire picture, telling BleepingComputer that there are 1,284 vulnerable servers exposed online, with 474 already having been compromised with webshells.

The vulnerabilities were discovered by Orange Cyberdefense's CSIRT, which was called in to investigate a compromised server. As part of the investigation, they discovered that two zero-day vulnerabilities impacting Craft CMS were exploited to breach the server: According to a report by SensePost, the ethical hacking team of Orange Cyberdefense, the threat actors chained both of these vulnerabilities together to breach servers and upload a PHP file manager. The attack begins with the exploitation of CVE-2025-32432, which allows attackers to send a specially crafted request containing a ""return URL"" as a parameter that is saved in a PHP session file. This session name is sent to the visitor as part of the response to the HTTP request. The second stage of the attack leveraged a flaw in the Yii framework (CVE-2024-58136), which Craft CMS utilizes. To exploit this flaw, the attacker sent a malicious JSON payload that caused the PHP code in the session file to be executed on the server. This allowed the attacker to install a PHP-based file manager on the server to compromise the system further. Orange told BleepingComputer that they saw additional compromise steps, including additional uploads of backdoors and data exfiltration. More information about this post-exploitation activity will be detailed in an upcoming blog post. The Yii developers ultimatelyfixed the CVE-2024-58136 flawin version Yii 2.0.52 released on April 9th.

After people installed this month'sMicrosoft Patch Tuesdaysecurity updates, Windows userssuddenly found an ""inetpub"" folderowned by the SYSTEM account created in the root of the system drive, normally the C: drive. It was strange to see this folder created as it is normally used to hold files associated with Microsoft's Internet Information Service web server, which was not installed on these devices. In an update to asecurity advisory, Microsoft later confirmed that the C:\inetpub folder was part of a fix for a Windows Process Activation elevation of privilege vulnerability tracked as CVE-2025-21204, with the companywarning not to delete the folder. ""After installing the updates listed in the Security Updates table for your operating system, a new %systemdrive%\inetpub folder will be created on your device,""confirmed Microsoft. ""This folder should not be deleted regardless of whether Internet Information Services (IIS) is active on the target device. This behavior is part of changes that increase protection and does not require any action from IT admins and end users."" However, cybersecurity expert Kevin Beaumont has demonstrated that this folder can be abused to prevent further Windows updates from being installed if it is created a certain way. ""I've discovered this fix introduces a denial of service vulnerability in the Windows servicing stack that allows non-admin users to stop all future Windows security updates,"" Kevin Beaumont. In a new report,Beaumont saysthat Windows users, even those without administrative privileges, can create a junction between C:\inetpub and a Windows file, like C:\windows\system32\notepad.exe using the following command. A Windows junction is a special type of folder that redirects access to another folder on the same or another drive, making it appear as though the content exists in both locations. When asked why this junction is preventing the update from being installed, Beaumont says he believes it's because the update expects a folder rather than a file. ""It works with basically any file, I think it's because the servicing stack expects c:\inetpub to be a directory - but mklink allows you to make a junction to a file,"" Beaumont told BleepingComputer. According toMicrosoft's documentation, junctions are meant to be links between folders rather than between files. However, as you can see from the image earlier in the article, it is still possible to create one as shown in the image below. With this junction created, if you attempt to install the April security update, it will not install correctly, giving a0x800F081F error code. This code is related to the error ""CBS_E_SOURCE_MISSING,"" which means a package or file was not found. Beaumont says he reported the bug to Microsoft, who has assigned it a ""Medium"" severity classification and closed his case, stating they will consider fixing it in the future. ""After careful investigation, this case is currently rated as a Moderate severity issue,""Microsoft emailed Beaumont. ""It does not meet MSRCs current bar for immediate servicing as the update fails to apply only if the 'inetpub' folder is a junction to a file and succeeds upon deleting the inetpub symlink and retrying.""

The vulnerability, tracked underCVE-2025-31324and rated critical (CVSS v3 score: 10.0), is an unauthenticated file upload vulnerability in SAP NetWeaver Visual Composer, specifically the Metadata Uploader component. It allows attackers to upload malicious executable files without logging in, potentially leading to remote code execution and full system compromise. Though thevendor's bulletinisn't public, ReliaQuest reported earlier this week about an actively exploited vulnerability on SAP NetWeaver Visual Composer, specifically the '/developmentserver/metadatauploader' endpoint, which aligns with CVE-2025-31324. ReliaQuestreportedthat multiple customers were compromised via unauthorized file uploads on SAP NetWeaver, with the attackers uploading JSP webshells to publicly accessible directories. These uploads enabled remote code execution via simple GET requests to the JSP files, allowing command execution from the browser, file management actions (upload/download), and more. In the post-exploitation phase, the attackers deployed the 'Brute Ratel' red team tool, the 'Heaven's Gate' security bypassing technique, and injected MSBuild-compiled code into dllhost.exe for stealth. ReliaQuest noted in the report that exploitation did not require authentication and that the compromised systems were fully patched, indicating that they were targeted by a zero-day exploit. Security firm watchTowr also confirmed to BleepingComputer they are seeing active exploitation linked to CVE-2025-31324.

The flaw tracked asCVE-2025-24054was fixed in Microsoft'sMarch 2025 Patch Tuesday. Initially, it was not marked as actively exploited and was assessed as 'less likely' to be. However, Check Point researchers report having observed active exploitation activity for CVE-2025-24054 only a few days after patches became available, culminating between March 20 and 25, 2025. Although one IP address behind these attacks was previously linked to the Russia state-sponsored threat group APT28 ('Fancy Bear'), it is not enough evidence for confident attribution. NTLM (New Technology LAN Manager) is a Microsoft authentication protocol that uses challenge-response negotiation involving hashes instead of transmitting plaintext passwords to authenticate users. While NTLM avoids transmitting plaintext passwords, it is no longer considered secure due to vulnerabilities likereplay attacksandbrute-force cracking of captured hashes. Due to this, Microsoft hasbegun phasing out NTLM authenticationin favor of Kerberos or Negotiate. In attacks seen by Check Point, phishing emails were sent to entities in Poland and Romania that included a Dropbox link to a ZIP archive, containing a .library-ms file. A library-ms file is a legitimate file type that, when opened, shows aWindows library, or virtual container, that contains files and folders from different configured sources. In this phishing attack, the library-ms file was created to contain a path to a remote SMB server under the attacker's control. When extracting a ZIP file that contains a .library-ms file, Windows Explorer will interact with it automatically, triggering the CVE-2025-24054 flaw and causing Windows to make an SMB connection to the URL specified in the file. When Windows connects to the remote SMB server, it will attempt to authenticate via NTLM, allowing the attacker to capture the user's NTLM hashes. In a later campaign, Check Point discovered phishing emails that contained .library-ms attachments, without an archive. Simply downloading the .library-ms file was enough to trigger NTLM authentication to the remote server, demonstrating that archives were not required to exploit the flaw. ""On March 25, 2025, Check Point Research discovered a campaign targeting companies around the world, distributing these files without being zipped,""explains Check Point. ""According to Microsoft, this exploit is triggered with minimal user interaction with a malicious file, such as selecting (single-clicking), inspecting (right-clicking), or performing any action other than opening or executing the file."" The malicious archive also contains three more files, namely 'xd.url,' 'xd.website,' and 'xd.link,' which leverage older NTLM hash leak flaws and are most likely included for redundancy in case the 'library-ms' method fails. Check Point says the attacker-controlled SMB servers in this campaign were using the 159.196.128[.]120 and 194.127.179[.]157 IP addresses. Capturing NTLM hashes could open the way to authentication bypass and privilege escalation, so even though CVE-2025-24054 is only evaluated as a ""medium"" severity issue, its potential consequences are grave. Given the low interaction required to exploit, organizations should treat this as a high-risk issue. It is advised that all organizations should install the March 2025 updates and turn off NTLM authentication if it is not required.

TheOttoKit WordPress pluginallows users to connect plugins and external tools like WooCommerce, Mailchimp, and Google Sheets, automate tasks like sending emails and adding users, or updating CRMs without code. Statisticsshowthat the product is active on 100,000 websites. Yesterday,Wordfence disclosedan authentication bypass vulnerability in OttoKit, identified as CVE-2025-3102. The flaw impacts all versions of SureTriggers/OttoKit up to 1.0.78. The flaw stems from a missing empty value check in theauthenticate_user()function, which handles REST API authentication. Exploitation to be possible if the plugin is not configured with an API key, which causes the storedsecret_keyto remain empty. An attacker could exploit this by sending an emptyst_authorizationheader to pass the check and grant unauthorized access to protected API endpoints. Essentially, CVE-2025-3102 allows attackers to create new administrator accounts without authentication, posing a high risk of full site takeover. Wordfence received a report about the flaw from security researcher 'mikemyers', who earned a bounty of $1,024 for the discovery in mid-March. The plugin vendor was contacted on April 3 with the full exploitation details, and they released a fix via version 1.0.79 on the same day. However, hackers quickly jumped at the opportunity to exploit the issue, taking advantage of administrators' delay in updating the plugin to address the security problem. Researchers at WordPress security platform Patchstack are warning that the first exploitation attempts in the wild were logged only a few hours after the disclosure of the flaw. “Attackers were quick to exploit this vulnerability, with the first recorded attempt occurring just four hours after it was added as a vPatch to our database,”reports Patchstack. “This swift exploitation highlights the critical need to apply patches or mitigations immediately upon the public disclosure of such vulnerabilities,” the researchers say. The threat actors attempt to create new administrator accounts using randomized username/password and email address combination, a sign of task automation. If you’re using OttoKit/SureTriggers, upgrade to version 1.0.79 as soon as possible and check logs for unexpected admin accounts or other user roles, installation of plugins/themes, database access events, and modification of security settings.

The vulnerability, tracked asCVE-2025-29824, was patched duringthis month's Patch Tuesdayand was only exploited in a limited number of attacks. CVE-2025-29824 is due to a use-after-free weakness that lets local attackers with low privileges gain SYSTEM privileges in low-complexity attacks that don't require user interaction. While the company has issued security updates for impacted Windows versions, it delayed releasing patches for systems running Windows 10 LTSB 2015 and said they would be released as soon as possible. ""The targets include organizations in the information technology (IT) and real estate sectors of the United States, the financial sector in Venezuela, a Spanish software company, and the retail sector in Saudi Arabia,""Microsoft revealed today. ""Customers running Windows 11, version 24H2 are not affected by the observed exploitation, even if the vulnerability was present. Microsoft urges customers to apply these updates as soon as possible."" Microsoft linked these attacks to the RansomEXX ransomware gang, which it tracks as Storm-2460. The attackers first installed the PipeMagic backdoor malware on compromised systems, which was used to deploy the CVE-2025-29824 exploit, ransomware payloads, and !_READ_ME_REXX2_!.txt ransom notes after encrypting files. ​As ESET reported last month, PipeMagic has also been used to deploy exploitstargeting a Windows Win32 Kernel Subsystem zero-day(CVE-2025-24983) since March 2023. Discovered by Kaspersky in 2022, the malware can harvest sensitive data, provides full remote access to infected devices, and enables attackers to deploy additional malicious payloads to move laterally through victims' networks. In 2023, Kaspersky spotted this backdoor while investigatingNokoyawa ransomware attacks. These attacks exploited another Windows Common Log File System Driver zero-day, a privilege escalation flaw tracked asCVE-2023-28252. TheRansomEXX ransomware operationstarted as Defray in 2018 but wasrebranded to RansomEXXand became much more active starting June 2020.

Described as a spoofing issue and tracked asCVE-2025-30401, this security flaw can be exploited by attackers by sending maliciously crafted files with altered file types to potential targets. Metasaysthe vulnerability impacted all WhatsApp versions and has been fixed with the release of WhatsApp 2.2450.6. ""A spoofing issue in WhatsApp for Windows prior to version 2.2450.6 displayed attachments according to their MIME type but selected the file opening handler based on the attachment's filename extension,"" WhatsAppexplained in a Tuesday advisory. ""A maliciously crafted mismatch could have caused the recipient to inadvertently execute arbitrary code rather than view the attachment when manually opening the attachment inside WhatsApp."" Meta says an external researcher found and reported the flaw via a Meta Bug Bounty submission. The company has yet to share if CVE-2025-30401 was exploited in the wild. In July 2024,WhatsApp addressed a slightly similar issuethat allowed Python and PHP attachments to be executed without warning when recipients opened them on Windows devices with Python installed. More recently, following reports from security researchers at the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab, WhatsApp alsopatched a zero-click, zero-day security vulnerabilitythat was exploited to install Paragon's Graphite spyware. The company said the attack vector was addressed late last year ""without the need for a client-side fix"" and decided against assigning a CVE-ID after ""reviewing the CVE guidelines published by MITRE, and [its] own internal policies."" On January 31, after mitigating the security issue server-side, WhatsAppalerted roughly 90 Android usersfrom over two dozen countries, includingItalian journalistsand activists who were targeted in Paragon spyware attacks using the zero-click exploit. Last December, a U.S. federal judge also ruled that Israeli spyware maker NSO Group used WhatsApp zero-days to deploy Pegasus spyware on at least 1,400 devices, thus violating U.S. hacking laws. Court documentsrevealed that NSO allegedly deployed Pegasus spyware in zero-click attacks that exploited WhatsApp vulnerabilities using multiple zero-day exploits. The documents also said that the spyware maker's developers reverse-engineered WhatsApp's code to create tools that sent malicious messages that installed spyware, violating federal and state laws.

The reported vulnerabilities areCVE-2025-24061(Mark of the Web bypass) andCVE-2025-24071(File Explorer spoofing), which Microsoft addressed during theMarch 2025 Patch Tuesdayupdates, acknowledging the reporter as 'SkorikARI with SkorikARI .' Anew report by Outpost24researchers has now linked the EncryptHub threat actor with SkorikARI after the threat actor allegedly infected himself and exposed their credentials. This exposure allowed the researchers to link the threat actor to various online accounts and expose the profile of a person who vacillates between being a cybersecurity researcher and a cybercriminal. One of the exposed accounts is SkorikARI, which the hacker used to disclose the two mentioned zero-day vulnerabilities to Microsoft, contributing to Windows security. Hector Garcia, Security Analyst at Outpost24, told BleepingComputer that the link of SkorikARI to EncryptHub is based on multiple pieces of evidence, making up for a high-confidence assessment. ""The hardest evidence was from the fact that the password files EncrypHub exfiltrated from his own system had accounts linked to both EncryptHub, like credentials to EncryptRAT, which was still in development, or his account on xss.is, and to SkorikARI, like accesses to freelance sites or his own Gmail account,"" explained Garcia. ""There was also a login to hxxps:// github[.]com/SkorikJR, which was mentioned in July's Fortinet Article about Fickle Stealer, bringing it all together."" ""Another huge confirmation of the link between the two were the conversations with ChatGPT, where activity related both to EncryptHub and to SkorikARI can be observed."" EncryptHub's foray into zero-days is not new, with the threat actor or one of the members attempting to sell zero-days to other cybercriminals on hacking forums. Outpost24 delved into EncryptHub's journey, stating that the hacker repeatedly shifts between freelance development work and cybercrime activity. Despite his apparent IT expertise, the hacker reportedly fell victim to bad opsec practices that allowed his personal information to be exposed. This includes the hacker's use of ChatGPT for developing malware and phishing sites, integrating third-party code, and researching vulnerabilities. The threat actor also had a deeper, personal engagement with OpenAI's LLM chatbot, in one case describing his accomplishments and asking the AI to categorize him as a cool hacker or malicious researcher. Based on the provided inputs, ChatGPT assessed him as 40% black hat, 30% grey hat, 20% white hat, and 10% uncertain, reflecting a morally and practically conflicted individual. The same conflict is reflected in his future planning on ChatGPT, where the hacker asks for the chatbot's help in organizing a massive but ""harmless"" campaign impacting tens of thousands of computers for publicity. EncryptHub is a threat actor that is believed to be loosely affiliated with ransomware gangs, such as RansomHub and the BlackSuit operations. However, more recently, the threat actors have made a name for themselves with various social engineering campaigns, phishing attacks, and creating a custom PowerShell-based infostealer namedFickle Stealer. The threat actor is also known for conducting social engineering campaigns where they create social media profiles and websites for fictitious applications. In one example,researchers foundthat the threat actor created an X account and website for a project management application called GartoriSpace. This site was promoted through private messages on social media platforms that would provide a code required to download the software. When downloading the software, Windows devices would receive a PPKG file [VirusTotal] that installed Fickle Stealer, and Mac devices would receive the AMOS information-stealer [VirusTotal]. EncryptHub has also beenlinked to Windows zero-day attacksexploiting a Microsoft Management Console vulnerability tracked as CVE-2025-26633. The flaw was fixed in March but was attributed to Trend Micro rather than the threat actor.

The security issue is tracked as CVE-2025-31334 and affects all WinRAR versions except the most recent release, which is currently 7.11. Mark of the Web is a security function in Windows in the form of a metadata value (an alternate data stream named ‘zone-identifier’) to tag as potentially unsafe files downloaded from the internet. When opening an executable with the MotW tag, Windows warns the user that it was downloaded from the internet and could be harmful and offers the option to continue execution or terminate it.  The CVE-2025-31334 vulnerability can help a threat actor bypass the MotW security warning when opening a symbolic link (symlink) pointing to an executable file in any WinRAR version before 7.11. An attacker could execute arbitrary code by using a specially crafted symbolic link. It should be noted that a symlink can be created on Windows only with administrator permissions. The security issue received amedium severity score of 6.8 and has been fixed in the latest version of WinRAR, as noted in the applications change log: “If symlink pointing at an executable was started from WinRAR shell, the executable Mark of the Web data was ignored” -WinRAR The vulnerability was reported by Shimamine Taihei of Mitsui Bussan Secure Directions through the Information Technology Promotion Agency (IPA) in Japan. Japan’s Computer Security Incident Response Teamcoordinatedthe responsible disclosure with WinRAR’s developer. Starting version 7.10, WinRAR provides the possibility to remove from the MotW alternate data stream information (e.g. location, IP address) that could be considered a privacy risk.

The problem stems from the deserialization of untrusted data that could allow attackers with specially crafted Parquet files to gain control of target systems, exfiltrate or modify data, disrupt services, or introduce dangerous payloads such as ransomware. The vulnerability is tracked underCVE-2025-30065and has a CVSS v4 score of 10.0. The flaw was fixed with the release of Apache version 1.15.1. It should be noted that to exploit this flaw, threat actors must convince someone to import a specially crafted Parquet file. Apache Parquet is an open-source, columnar storage format designed for efficient data processing. Unlike row-based formats (like CSV), Parquet stores data by columns, which makes it faster and more space-efficient for analytical workloads. It is widely adopted across the data engineering and analytics ecosystem, including big data platforms like Hadoop, AWS, Amazon, Google, and Azure cloud services, data lakes, and ETL tools. Some large companies that use Parquet include Netflix, Uber, Airbnb, and LinkedIn. The security problem in Parquet was disclosed on April 1, 2025, following a responsible disclosure by its finder, Amazon researcher Keyi Li. ""Schema parsing in the parquet-avro module of Apache Parquet 1.15.0 and previous versions allows bad actors to execute arbitrary code,"" warned the shortbulletin published on Openwall. ""Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.15.1, which fixes the issue."" A separate bulletin by Endor Labs highlights the risk of CVE-2025-30065 exploitation more clearly, warning that the flaw can impact any data pipelines and analytics systems that import Parquet files, with the risk being significant for files sourced from external points. Endor Labs believes the problem was introduced in Parquet version 1.8.0, though older releases might also be impacted. The firm suggests coordinated checks with developers and vendors to determine what Praquet versions are used in production software stacks. ""If an attacker tricks a vulnerable system into reading a specially crafted Parquet file, they could gain remote code execution (RCE) on that system,""warns Endor Labs. However, the security firm avoids over-inflating the risk by including the note, ""Despite the frightening potential, it's important to note that the vulnerability can only be exploited if a malicious Parquet file is imported."" That being said, if upgrading to Apache Parquet 1.15.1 immediately is impossible, it is suggested to avoid untrusted Parquet files or carefully validate their safety before processing them. Also, monitoring and logging on systems that handle Parquet processing should be increased. Although no active exploitation has been discovered yet, the risk is high due to the flaw's severity and the widespread use of Parquet files in big data applications. Administrators of impacted systems are recommended to upgrade to Parquet version 1.15.1, which addresses CVE-2025-30065, as soon as possible.

While Ivanti has yet to disclose more details regarding CVE-2025-22457 attacks, Mandiant and Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) security researchers revealed today that a suspected China-nexus espionage actor exploited the vulnerability tracked as UNC5221 since at least mid-March 2025. ""Following successful exploitation, we observed the deployment of two newly identified malware families, the TRAILBLAZE in-memory only dropper and the BRUSHFIRE passive backdoor. Additionally, deployment of the previously reported SPAWN ecosystem of malware attributed to UNC5221 was also observed,""Mandiant said. ""We assess it is likely the threat actor studied the patch for the vulnerability in ICS 22.7R2.6 and uncovered through a complicated process, it was possible to exploit 22.7R2.5 and earlier to achieve remote code execution."" UNC5221 is known for targeting zero-day vulnerabilities in network edge devices since 2023, including various Ivanti and NetScaler appliances. Most recently, the Chinese hackersexploited CVE-2025-0282, another Ivanti Connect Secure buffer overflow, to drop new Dryhook and Phasejam malware on compromised VPN appliances. One year ago, the hacking group alsochained two Connect Secure and Policy Secure zero-days(CVE-2023-46805 and CVE-2024-21887) to remotely execute arbitrary commands on targeted ICS VPN and IPS network access control (NAC) appliances. One of their victims wasthe MITRE Corporation, whichdisclosed the breach in April 2024. ​Threat intelligence company Volexity said in January 2024 that UNC5221 hadbackdoored over 2,100 Ivanti appliancesusing the GIFTEDVISITOR webshell in attacks chaining the two zero days. As CISA and the FBI warned in January 2025, attackers are still breaching vulnerable networks using exploits targetingIvanti Cloud Service Appliances (CSA) security vulnerabilitiespatched since September. Multiple other Ivanti security flawshave beenexploitedas zero-daysover the last year against the company'sVPN appliancesandICS, IPS, and ZTA gateways. Update April 03, 14:16 EDT:Ivanti CSO Daniel Spicer sent the following statement after the story was published. Network security devices and edge devices in particular are a focus of sophisticated and highly persistent threat actors, and Ivanti is committed to providing information to defenders to ensure they can take every possible step to secure their environments. To this end, in addition to providing an advisory directly to customers, Ivanti worked closely with its partner Mandiant to provide additional information regarding this recently addressed vulnerability. Importantly, this vulnerability was fixed in ICS 22.7R2.6, released February 11, 2025, and customers running supported versions on their appliances and in accordance with the guidance provided by Ivanti have a significantly reduced risk. Ivanti’s Integrity Checker Tool (ICT) has been successful in detecting potential compromise on a limited number of customers running ICS 9.X (end of life) and 22.7R2.5 and earlier versions.

CSLU is a Windows app for managing licenses and linked products on-premises without connecting them to Cisco's cloud-based Smart Software Manager solution. Ciscopatched this security flaw(CVE-2024-20439) in September, describing it as ""an undocumented static user credential for an administrative account"" that lets unauthenticated attackers log into unpatched systems remotely with admin privileges over the Cisco Smart Licensing Utility (CSLU) app's API. CVE-2024-20439 only impacts systems running vulnerable Cisco Smart Licensing Utility releases, but it's only exploitable if the user starts the CSLU app (which doesn't run in the background by default). Aruba threat researcher Nicholas Starke reverse-engineered the vulnerability two weeks after Cisco released security patches andpublished a write-upwith technical details (including the decoded hardcoded static password). ""In March 2025, the Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) became aware of attempted exploitation of this vulnerability in the wild,"" the companysaid in a Tuesday updateto the original security advisory. ""Cisco continues to strongly recommend that customers upgrade to a fixed software release to remediate this vulnerability."" While Cisco didn't share any details on these attacks, Johannes Ullrich, SANS Technology Institute's Dean of Research, spotted a campaign last month that used the backdoor admin account to attack CSLU instances exposed online. Ullrichsaid in Marchthat threat actors are chaining CVE-2024-20439 with a second flaw, a critical CLSU information disclosure vulnerability (CVE-2024-20440) that unauthenticated attackers can exploit to gain access to log files containing sensitive data (including API credentials) by sending crafted HTTP requests to vulnerable devices. ""A quick search didn't show any active exploitation [at the time], but details, including the backdoor credentials, were published in a blog by Nicholas Starke shortly after Cisco released its advisory. So it is no surprise that we are seeing some exploit activity,"" Ullrich said. On Monday, CISA added the CVE-2024-20439 static credential vulnerability to itsKnown Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, ordering U.S. federal agencies to secure their systems against active exploitation within three weeks, by April 21. This isn't the first backdoor account removed from Cisco products in recent years, with previous hardcoded credentials found in itsIOS XE,Wide Area Application Services (WAAS),Digital Network Architecture (DNA) Center, andEmergency Respondersoftware.

The security vulnerability (CVE-2025-2825) was discovered and reported by Outpost24 (which identifies it asCVE-2025-31161), and it allows remote attackers to gain unauthenticated access to devices running unpatched CrushFTP v10 or v11 software. ""Please take immediate action to patch ASAP. The bottom line of this vulnerability is that an exposed HTTP(S) port could lead to unauthenticated access,""CrushFTP warnedin an email sent to customers on Friday, March 21, when it released patches to address the security flaw. As a workaround, admins who can't immediately update CrushFTP 10.8.4 and later or 11.3.1 and later can enable the DMZ (demilitarized zone) perimeter network option to protect their CrushFTP servers until they can patch. A week later, security threat monitoring platform Shadowserver warned that its honeypots detecteddozens of exploitation attemptstargeting Internet-exposed CrushFTP servers, with over 1,500 vulnerable instances exposed online. ​The warning comes days afterProjectDiscovery publisheda write-up containing technical details and a proof-of-concept exploit on the CVE-2025-2825/CVE-2025-31161 vulnerability.
