CVE-2025-2783,2025-05-16,bleeping computer,"On Thursday, CISA warned U.S. federal agencies to secure their systems against ongoing attacks exploiting a high-severity vulnerability in the Chrome web browser. Solidlab security researcher Vsevolod Kokorin discovered the flaw (CVE-2025-4664) and shared technical details online on May 5th. Googlereleased security updatesto patch it on Wednesday. As Kokorin explained, the vulnerability isdueto insufficient policy enforcement in Google Chrome's Loader component, and successful exploitation can allow remote attackers to leak cross-origin data via maliciously crafted HTML pages. ""You probably know that unlike other browsers, Chrome resolves the Link header on subresource requests. But what's the problem? The issue is that the Link header can set a referrer-policy. We can specify unsafe-url and capture the full query parameters,""Kokorin noted. ""Query parameters can contain sensitive data - for example, in OAuth flows, this might lead to an Account Takeover. Developers rarely consider the possibility of stealing query parameters via an image from a 3rd-party resource."" While Google didn't disclose if the vulnerability was previously abused in attacks or if it's still being exploited, it warned in a security advisory that it has a public exploit, which is how it usually hints at active exploitation. One day later,CISA confirmedCVE-2025-4664 is being abused in the wild and added it to theKnown Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog, which lists security flaws actively exploited in attacks. As mandated by the November 2021 Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01, U.S. Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies must patch their Chrome installation within three weeks, by May 7th, to secure their systems against potential breaches. While this directive only applies to federal agencies, all network defenders are advised to prioritize patching this vulnerability as soon as possible. ""These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise,"" the cybersecurity agency warned. This is the second actively exploited Chrome zero-day patched by Google this year, afteranother high-severity Chrome zero-daybug (CVE-2025-2783), which was abused to target Russian government organizations, media outlets, and educational institutions in cyber-espionage attacks.

CVE-2022-2601,2025-05-14,bleeping computer,"Microsoft has fixed a known issue preventing Linux from booting on dual-boot systems with Secure Boot enabled after installing the August 2024 Windows security updates. The list of affected systems includes those running client (Windows 10 and Windows 11) and server (Windows Server 2012 and later) OS versions. This issue is triggered by a Secure Boot Advanced Targeting (SBAT) update that blocksUEFI shim bootloadersvulnerable to exploits targeting theCVE-2022-2601GRUB2 Secure Boot bypass. While Microsoft said in the CVE-2022-2601 advisory that this SBAT update would not be delivered to devices where dual booting is detected, it also acknowledged that the dual-boot detection failed to detect some customized methods of dual-booting and applied the update anyway.

Microsoftconfirmed the known issuefollowing widespread reports, saying that affected users saw ""Something has gone seriously wrong: SBAT self-check failed: Security Policy Violation"" errors on systems rendered unbootable. This week, nine months after confirming the issue, Microsoft announced that the May 2025 Patch Tuesday security updates should fix the boot problems for all affected users.

CVE-2025-32756,2025-05-13,bleeping computer,"Fortinet released security updates to patch a critical remote code execution vulnerability exploited as a zero-day in attacks targeting FortiVoice enterprise phone systems. The security flaw is a stack-based overflow vulnerability tracked asCVE-2025-32756that also impacts FortiMail, FortiNDR, FortiRecorder, and FortiCamera. As the company explains in a security advisory issued on Tuesday, successful exploitation can allow remote unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code or commands via maliciously crafted HTTP requests. Fortinet's Product Security Team discovered CVE-2025-32756 based on attackers' activity, including network scans, system crashlogs deletion to cover their tracks, and 'fcgi debugging' being toggled on to log credentials from the system or SSH login attempts. As detailed in today's security advisory, the threat actors have launched attacks from half a dozen IP addresses, including 198.105.127[.]124, 43.228.217[.]173, 43.228.217[.]82, 156.236.76[.]90, 218.187.69[.]244, and 218.187.69[.]59. Indicators of compromise spotted by Fortinet during the attacks' analysis include the 'fcgi debugging' setting (which isn't toggled on by default), enabled on compromised systems. To check if this setting is turned on on your system, you should see ""general to-file ENABLED"" after running the following command:diag debug application fcgi. While investigating these attacks, Fortinet has observed the threat actors deploying malware on hacked devices, adding cron jobs designed to harvest credentials, and dropping scripts to scan the victims' networks. The company also shared mitigation advice for customers who can't immediately install today's security updates, which requires them to disable the HTTP/HTTPS administrative interface on vulnerable devices. Last month, the Shadowserver Foundationdiscovered over 16,000 internet-exposed Fortinet devicescompromised using a new symlink backdoor that provides threat actors with read-only access to sensitive files on now-patched devices hacked in previous attacks.

CVE-2024-45332,2025-05-13,bleeping computer,"A new ""Branch Privilege Injection"" flaw in all modern Intel CPUs allows attackers to leak sensitive data from memory regions allocated to privileged software like the operating system kernel. Typically, these regions are populated with information like passwords, cryptographic keys, memory of other processes, and kernel data structures, so protecting them from leakage is crucial. According toETH Zurich researchersSandro Rüegge, Johannes Wikner, and Kaveh Razavi, Spectre v2 mitigations held for six years, but their latest ""Branch Predictor Race Conditions"" exploit effectively bypasses them. The flaw, which is named 'branch privilege injection' and tracked underCVE-2024-45332, is a race condition on the subsystem of branch predictors used in Intel CPUs. Branch predictors like Branch Target Buffer (BTB) and Indirect Branch Predictor (IBP) are specialized hardware components that try to guess the outcome of a branch instruction before it's resolved to keep the CPU pipeline full for optimal performance. These predictions are speculative, meaning they are undone if they end up being wrong. However, if they are correct, it increases performance. The researchers found that Intel's branch predictor updates are not synchronized with instruction execution, resulting in these updates traversing privilege boundaries. If a privilege switch happens, like from user mode to kernel mode, there is a small window of opportunity during which the update is associated with the wrong privilege level. As a result, isolation between user and kernel is broken, and a non-privileged user can leak data from privileged processes. ETH Zurich's team developed an exploit that trains the CPU to predict a specific branch target, then makes a system call to move execution into the OS kernel, leading to speculative execution using the attacker-controlled target (""gadget""). This code accesses secret data loaded into the cache, and using a side-channel method, the contents are leaked to the attacker. The researchers demonstrated their attack on Ubuntu 24.04 with default mitigations enabled to read the contents of the '/etc/shadow/' file containing hashed account passwords. The exploit can achieve peak leak rates of 5.6 KB/sec at 99.8% accuracy. CVE-2024-45332 impacts all Intel CPUs from the ninth generation onward, including Coffee Lake, Comet Lake, Rocket Lake, Alder Lake, and Raptor Lake. ""All intel processors since the 9th generation (Coffee Lake Refresh) are affected by Branch Privilege Injection,"" explains the researchers. ""However, we have observed predictions bypassing the Indirect Branch Prediction Barrier (IBPB) on processors as far back as 7th generation (Kaby Lake)."" ETH Zurich researchers did not test older generations at this time, but since they do not support Enhanced Indirect Branch Restricted Speculation (eIBRS), they're less relevant to this specific exploit and likely more prone to older Spectre v2-like attacks. Arm Cortex-X1, Cortex-A76, and AMD Zen 5 and Zen 4 chips were also examined, but they do not exhibit the same asynchronous predictor behavior, so they are not vulnerable to CVE-2024-45332. Although the attack was demonstrated on Linux, the flaw is present on the hardware level, so it's theoretically exploitable on Windows too. The researchers reported their findings to Intel in September 2024, and the tech giant released microcode updates that mitigate CVE-2024-45332 on impacted models. The firmware-level mitigations introduce a 2.7% performance overhead, while software mitigations have a performance impact between 1.6% and 8.3%, depending on the CPU. The risk is low for regular users, and attacks have multiple strong prerequisites to open up realistic exploitation scenarios. That being said, applying the latest BIOS/UEFI and OS updates is recommended. ETH Zurich will present the full details of their exploit in a technical paper at the upcomingUSENIX Security 2025. Update 5/13 -Intel published asecurity bulletin about CVE-2024-45332and also sent BleepingComputer the below comment: “We appreciate the work done by ETH Zurich on this research and collaboration on coordinated public disclosure.

CVE-2025-3462,2025-05-12,bleeping computer,"The ASUS DriverHub driver management utility was vulnerable to a critical remote code execution flaw that allowed malicious sites to execute commands on devices with the software installed. The flaw was discovered by an independent cybersecurity researcher from New Zealand named Paul (aka ""MrBruh""), who found that the software had poor validation of commands sent to the DriverHub background service. This allowed the researcher to create an exploit chain utilizing flaws tracked asCVE-2025-3462andCVE-2025-3463that, when combined, achieve origin bypass and trigger remote code execution on the target. DriverHub is ASUS's official driver management tool that is automatically installed on the first system boot when utilizing certain ASUS motherboards. This software runs in the background, automatically detecting and fetching the latest driver versions for the detected motherboard model and its chipset. Once installed, the tool remains active and running in the background via a local service on port 53000, continually checking for important driver updates. Meanwhile, most users don't even know such a service is constantly running on their system. That service checks the Origin Header of incoming HTTP requests to reject anything that doesn't come from 'driverhub.asus.com.' However, this check is poorly implemented, as any site that includes that string is accepted even if it's not an exact match to ASUS's official portal. The second issue lies in the UpdateApp endpoint, which allows DriverHub to download and run .exe files from "".asus.com"" URLs without user confirmation. An attacker can target any user with ASUS DriverHub running on their system to trick them into visiting a malicious website on their browser. This website then sends ""UpdateApp requests"" to the local service at 'http://127.0.0.1:53000.' By spoofing the Origin Header to something like 'driverhub.asus.com.mrbruh.com,' the weak validation check is bypassed, so DriverHub accepts the commands. In the researcher's demonstration, the commands order the software to download a legitimate ASUS-signed 'AsusSetup.exe' installer from the vendor's download portal, along with a malicious .ini file and .exe payload. The ASUS-signed installer is silently run as admin and uses the configuration information in the .ini file. This ini file directs the legitimate ASUS driver installer to launch the malicious executable file. The attack is also made possible by the tool failing to delete files that fail signature checks, like the .ini and payload, which are kept on the host after their download. ASUS received the researcher's reports on April 8, 2025, and implemented a fix on April 18, after validating it with MrBruh the day before. The hardware giant did not offer the researcher any bounty for his disclosure. The CVE descriptions, which the Taiwanese vendor submitted, somewhat downplays the issue with the following statement: ""This issue is limited to motherboards and does not affect laptops, desktop computers, or other endpoints,"" reads the CVE description. This is confusing, as the mentioned CVEs impact laptops and desktop computers with DriverHub installed. However, ASUS is clearer in its security bulletin, advising users to quickly apply the latest update. ""This update includes important security updates and ASUS strongly recommends that users update their ASUS DriverHub installation to the latest version,""reads the bulletin. ""The latest Software Update can be accessed by opening ASUS DriverHub, then clicking the ""Update Now"" button."" MrBruh says he monitored certificate transparency updates and found no other TLS certificates containing the ""driverhub.asus.com"" string, indicating it was not exploited in the wild.

CVE-2025-27920,2025-05-12,bleeping computer,"A Türkiye-backed cyberespionage group exploited a zero-day vulnerability to attack Output Messenger users linked to the Kurdish military in Iraq. Microsoft Threat Intelligence analysts who spotted these attacks also discovered the security flaw (CVE-2025-27920) in the LAN messaging application, a directory traversal vulnerability that can let authenticated attackers access sensitive files outside the intended directory or deploy malicious payloads on the server's startup folder. ""Attackers could access files such as configuration files, sensitive user data, or even source code, and depending on the file contents, this could lead to further exploitation, including remote code execution,"" Srimax, the app's developer,explainsin a security advisory issued in December when the bug was patched with the release of Output Messenger V2.0.63. Microsoft revealed on Monday that the hacking group (also tracked as Sea Turtle, SILICON, and UNC1326) targeted users who hadn't updated their systems to infect them with malware after gaining access to the Output Messenger Server Manager application. After compromising the server, Marbled Dust hackers could steal sensitive data, access all user communications, impersonate users, gain access to internal systems, and cause operational disruptions. ""While we currently do not have visibility into how Marbled Dust gained authentication in each instance, we assess that the threat actor leverages DNS hijacking or typo-squatted domains to intercept, log, and reuse credentials, as these are techniques leveraged by Marbled Dust in previously observed malicious activity,""Microsoft said. Next, the attackers deployed a backdoor (OMServerService.exe)onto the victims' devices, which checked connectivity against an attacker-controlled command-and-control domain (api.wordinfos[.]com) and then provided the threat actors with additional information to identify each victim. ​In one instance, the Output Messenger client on a victim's device connected to an IP address linked to the Marbled Dust threat group, likely for data exfiltration, shortly after the attacker instructed the malware to collect files and archive them as a RAR archive. Marbled Dust is known for targeting Europe and the Middle East, focusing on telecommunications and IT companies, as well as government institutions and organizations opposing the Turkish government. To breach the networks of infrastructure providers, they're scanning for vulnerabilities in internet-facing devices. They're also exploiting their access to compromised DNS registries to change government organizations' DNS server configurations, which allows them to intercept traffic and steal credentials in man-in-the-middle attacks. ""This new attack signals a notable shift in Marbled Dust's capability while maintaining consistency in their overall approach,"" Microsoft added. ""The successful use of a zero-day exploit suggests an increase in technical sophistication and could also suggest that Marbled Dust's targeting priorities have escalated or that their operational goals have become more urgent."" Last year, Marbled Dust was alsolinked to multiple espionage campaignstargeting organizations in the Netherlands, mainly targeting telecommunications companies, internet service providers (ISPs), and Kurdish websites between 2021 and 2023.

CVE-2025-31324,2025-05-09,bleeping computer,"Forescout Vedere Labs security researchers have linked ongoing attacks targeting a maximum severity vulnerability impacting SAP NetWeaver instances to a Chinese threat actor. SAPreleased an out-of-band emergency patchon April 24 to address this unauthenticated file upload security flaw (tracked asCVE-2025-31324) in SAP NetWeaver Visual Composer, days after cybersecurity companyReliaQuestfirst detected the vulnerability being targeted in attacks. Successful exploitation enables unauthenticated attackers to upload malicious files without logging in, allowing them to gain remote code execution and potentially leading to complete system compromise. ReliaQuest reported that multiple customers' systems were breached through unauthorized file uploads on SAP NetWeaver, with the threat actors uploading JSP web shells to public directories, as well as the Brute Ratel red team tool in the post-exploitation phase of their attacks. The compromised SAP NetWeaver servers were fully patched, indicating that the attackers used a zero-day exploit. This exploitation activity was also confirmed by other cybersecurity firms, including watchTowr andOnapsis, who also confirmed the attackers were uploading web shell backdoors on unpatched instances exposed online. Mandiantalso observedCVE-2025-31324 zero-day attacks dating back to at least mid-March 2025, while Onapsis updated its original report to say its honeypot first captured reconnaissance activity and payload testing since January 20, with exploitation attempts starting on February 10. The Shadowserver Foundation is nowtracking 204 SAP Netweaver serversexposed online and vulnerable to CVE-2025-31324 attacks. Onyphe CTO Patrice Auffret also told BleepingComputer in late April that ""Something like 20 Fortune 500/Global 500 companies are vulnerable, and many of them are compromised,"" adding that at the time, there were 1,284 vulnerable instances exposed online, 474 of which were already compromised. More recent attacks on April 29 have been linked to a Chinese threat actor tracked byForescout's Vedere Labsas Chaya_004. These attacks were launched from IP addresses using anomalous self-signed certificates impersonating Cloudflare, many of them belonging to Chinese cloud providers (e.g., Alibaba, Shenzhen Tencent, Huawei Cloud Service, and China Unicom). The attacker also deployed Chinese-language tools during the breaches, including a web-based reverse shell (SuperShell) developed by a Chinese-speaking developer. ""As part of our investigation into active exploitation of this vulnerability, we uncovered malicious infrastructure likely belonging to a Chinese threat actor, which we are currently tracking as Chaya_004 – following our convention for unnamed threat actors,"" Forescout said. ""The infrastructure includes a network of servers hosting Supershell backdoors, often deployed on Chinese cloud providers, and various pen testing tools, many of Chinese origin."" SAP admins are advised to immediately patch their NetWeaver instances, restrict access to metadata uploader services, monitor for suspicious activity on their servers, and consider disabling the Visual Composer service if possible. CISA has alsoaddedthe CVE-2025-31324 security flaw to itsKnown Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalogone week ago, ordering U.S. federal agencies to secure their systems against these attacks by May 20, as required byBinding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01. ""These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise,"" CISA warned.

CVE-2025-20188,2025-05-08,bleeping computer,"Cisco has fixed a maximum severity flaw in IOS XE Software for Wireless LAN Controllers by a hard-coded JSON Web Token (JWT) that allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to take over devices. This token is meant to authenticate requests to a feature called 'Out-of-Band AP Image Download.' Since it's hard-coded, anyone can impersonate an authorized user without credentials. The vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2025-20188 and has a maximum 10.0 CVSS score, allowing threat actors to fully compromise devices according to the vendor. ""An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTPS requests to the AP image download interface,""reads Cisco's bulletin. ""A successful exploit could allow the attacker to upload files, perform path traversal, and execute arbitrary commands with root privileges."" It is noted that CVE-2025-20188 is only exploitable when the 'Out-of-Band AP Image Download' feature is enabled on the device, which isn't enabled by default. The 'Out-of-Band AP Image Download' feature allows access points (APs) to download OS images via HTTPS rather than over the CAPWAP protocol, allowing a more flexible and direct way to get firmware onto APs. That said, although it's disabled by default, some large-scale or automated enterprise deployments may enable it for faster provisioning or recovery of APs. The following devices are vulnerable to attacks if the exploitation requirements are met: On the other hand, products confirmed not to be impacted by the hard-coded JWT issue are: Cisco IOS (non-XE), Cisco IOS XR, Cisco Meraki products, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco AireOS-based WLCs. Cisco has released security updates to address the critical vulnerability, so system administrators are advised to apply them as soon as possible. Users can determine the exact version that fixes the flaw for their device using the Cisco Software Checker for their specific device model. Although there are no mitigations or workarounds for CVE-2025-20188, disabling the 'Out-of-Band AP Image Download' feature is a solid defense. At this time, Cisco is unaware of any cases of active exploitation for CVE-2025-20188. However, given the severity of the issue, threat actors are likely to start scanning for exposed vulnerable endpoints immediately.

CVE-2025-29824,2025-05-07,bleeping computer,"The Play ransomware gang has exploited a high-severity Windows Common Log File System flaw in zero-day attacks to gain SYSTEM privileges and deploy malware on compromised systems. The vulnerability, tracked asCVE-2025-29824, was tagged by Microsoft as exploited in a limited number of attacks and patched duringlast month's Patch Tuesday. ""The targets include organizations in the information technology (IT) and real estate sectors of the United States, the financial sector in Venezuela, a Spanish software company, and the retail sector in Saudi Arabia,""Microsoft said in April. Microsoft linked these attacks to the RansomEXX ransomware gang, saying the attackers installed the PipeMagic backdoor malware, which was used to drop the CVE-2025-29824 exploit, deploy ransomware payloads, and ransom notes after encrypting files. Since then, Symantec's Threat Hunter Team has also found evidence linking them to the Play ransomware-as-a-service operation, saying the attackers deployed a CVE-2025-29824 zero-day privilege escalation exploit after breaching a U.S. organization's network. ""Although no ransomware payload was deployed in the intrusion, the attackers deployed the Grixba infostealer, which is a custom tool associated with Balloonfly, the attackers behind the Play ransomware operation,""Symantec said. ""Balloonfly is a cybercrime group that has been active since at least June 2022 and uses the Play ransomware (also known as PlayCrypt) in attacks."" The Grixba custom network-scanning and information-stealing toolwas first spotted two years ago, and Play ransomware operators typically use it to enumerate users and computers in compromised networks. The Play cybercrime gang surfaced in June 2022 and is also known for double-extortion attacks, in which its affiliates pressure victims into paying ransoms to avoid having their stolen data leaked online. In December 2023, the FBIissued a joint advisorywith CISA and the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), warning that the Play ransomware gang had breached the networks of around 300 organizations worldwide as of October 2023. Previous notable Play ransomware victims include cloud computing companyRackspace, car retailer giantArnold Clark, theCity of Oaklandin California,Dallas County, theBelgian city of Antwerp, and, more recently, American semiconductor supplierMicrochip Technologyanddoughnut chain Krispy Kreme.

CVE-2019-3568,2025-05-07,bleeping computer,"A U.S. federal jury has ordered Israeli spyware vendor NSO Group to pay WhatsApp $167,254,000 in punitive damages and $444,719 in compensatory damages for a 2019 campaign that targeted 1,400 users of the communication app. The verdict is considered a landmark case for being the first time a spyware vendor is held accountable in court, and could send ripples across the commercial spyware industry. ""Today's verdict in WhatsApp's case is an important step forward for privacy and security as the first victory against the development and use of illegal spyware that threatens the safety and privacy of everyone,"" commented Meta, WhatsApp's owner, inan announcement. ""Today, the jury's decision to force NSO, a notorious foreign spyware merchant, to pay damages is a critical deterrent to this malicious industry against their illegal acts aimed at American companies and the privacy and security of the people we serve."" The fines stem from a May 2019 campaign when NSO attempted to infect 1,400 WhatsApp users with its Pegasus spyware using a WhatsApp zero-day vulnerability. It was later revealed that the vulnerability NSO leveraged during this operation wasCVE-2019-3568, a buffer overflow in the WhatsApp VOIP stack, allowing attackers to send specially crafted RTCP packets to a target phone number to achieveremote code execution. When recipients received these calls, even if they did not answer, the vulnerability was automatically exploited, allowing Pegasus to be installed on devices. Meta filed the lawsuit against NSO Group on October 29, 2019, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that NSO had exploited a vulnerability in WhatsApp's calling feature to deliver its Pegasus spyware to approximately 1,400 users. Although NSO Group claims that its products are used by law enforcement tackling serious crime, Meta confirmed that the targets included human rights activists, journalists, and diplomats. The trial that included NSO executives' testimonies revealed that the spyware vendor is directly involved in infection operations, so they have direct liability. Also, they were forced to admit they spent tens of millions in USD to develop multiple infection channels besides WhatsApp. Court documentsalso revealedthat the NSO Group used at least one more zero-day vulnerability in WhatsApp software to target users with spyware even after Meta's lawsuit had been submitted. On December 23, 2024, Judge Phyllis J. Hamiltonruledthat NSO Group is liable for violating U.S. hacking laws and WhatsApp's Terms of Service, granting partial summary judgment in WhatsApp's favor and moving the case to a jury trial to determine damages. Finally, WhatsApp was awarded punitive damage compensation of $167,254,000, plus an extra $444,719 compensation for the incident investigation, vulnerability patching, and user notification. CitizenLab researcher John Scott-Railton welcomed the court's decision andwarned spyware firmsthey could be next.

CVE-2025-26647,2025-05-07,bleeping computer,"Microsoft says the April 2025 security updates are causing authentication issues on some Windows Server 2025 domain controllers. The list of impacted platforms includes Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2022, and the latest version, Windows Server 2025. However, as the company further explained, home users are unlikely to be affected by this known issue since domain controllers are typically used for business and enterprise authentication. ""After installing the April Windows monthly security update released April 8, 2025 (KB5055523) or later, Active Directory Domain Controllers (DC) might experience issues when processing Kerberos logons or delegations using certificate-based credentials that rely on key trust via the Active Directory msds-KeyCredentialLink field,"" Microsoft said in a Windows release health update. ""This can result in authentication issues in Windows Hello for Business (WHfB) Key Trust environments or environments that have deployed Device Public Key Authentication (also known as Machine PKINIT)."" These problems could also impact software relying on these two features for authentication, including but not limited to third-party single sign-on (SSO) solutions, identity management systems, and smart card authentication products. Affected auth protocols include Kerberos Public Key Cryptography for Initial Authentication (Kerberos PKINIT) and Certificate-based Service-for-User Delegation (S4U) via Kerberos Resource-Based Constrained Delegation (RBKCD or A2DF Delegation) or Kerberos Constrained Delegation (KCD or A2D2 Delegation).

""An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could be assigned much greater rights by the Key Distribution Center to the certificate than intended,"" Redmond explains. ""An authenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by obtaining a certificate containing the target Subject Key Identifier (SKI) value from a Certificate Authority (CA). The attacker could then use this certificate to get a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) for the target user from the Key Distribution Center (KDC).""

CVE-2025-30065,2025-05-06,bleeping computer,"A proof-of-concept exploit tool has been publicly released for a maximum severity Apache Parquet vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-30065, making it easy to find vulnerable servers. The tool was released by F5 Labs researchers who investigated the vulnerability after finding that multiple existing PoCs were either weak or completely non-functional. The tool serves as proof of CVE-2025-30065's practical exploitability and can also help administrators evaluate their environments and secure servers. Apache Parquet is an open-source, columnar storage format designed for efficient data processing, widely used by big data platforms and organizations engaged in data engineering and analytics. The flaw was first disclosed on April 1, 2025, following an earlier discovery by Amazon researcher Keyi Li. It was categorized as a remote code execution impacting all versions of Apache Parquet up to and including 1.15.0. From a technical perspective, CVE-2025-30065 is a deserialization flaw in the parquet-avro module of Apache Parquet Java, where the library fails to restrict which Java classes can be instantiated when reading Avro data embedded in Parquet files. On April 2, 2025,Endor Labspublished a write-up warning about the risk of exploitation and its potential impact on systems that import Parquet files from external points. Subsequent analysis by F5 Labs shows that the flaw is not a full deserialization RCE but can still be misused if a class has side effects during instantiation, like when making a network request from the vulnerable system to an attacker-controlled server. However, the researchers concluded that practical exploitation is difficult, and CVE-2025-30065 has limited value to attackers. ""While Parquet and Avro are used widely, this issue requires a specific set of circumstances that isn't all that likely in general,""reads the F5 Labs report. ""Even then, this CVE only allows attackers to trigger the instantiation of a Java object which then must have a side effect that is useful for the attacker."" Despite the low likelihood of exploitation, the researchers admit that some organizations process Parquet files from external, often unverified sources, and hence the risk is significant in some environments. For this reason, F5 Labs created a ""canary exploit"" tool (available on GitHub) that triggers an HTTP GET request via instantiation of javax.swing.JEditorKit, allowing users to verify exposure. Besides using the tool, it is recommended to upgrade to Apache Parquet version 15.1.1 or later, and configure 'org.apache.parquet.avro.SERIALIZABLE_PACKAGES' to restrict which packages are allowed for deserialization. Based on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.

CVE-2024-7399,2025-05-06,bleeping computer,"Hackers are exploiting an unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in the Samsung MagicINFO 9 Server to hijack devices and deploy malware. Samsung MagicINFO Server is a centralized content management system (CMS) used to remotely manage and control digital signage displays made by Samsung. It is used by retail stores, airports, hospitals, corporate buildings, and restaurants, where there's a need to schedule, distribute, display, and monitor multimedia content. The server component features a file upload functionality intended for updating display content, but hackers are abusing it to upload malicious code. The flaw, tracked underCVE-2024-7399, was first publiclydisclosed in August 2024when it was fixed as part of the release of version 21.1050. The vendor described the vulnerability as an ""Improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory vulnerability in Samsung MagicINFO 9 Server [that] allows attackers to write arbitrary file as system authority."" On April 30, 2025, security researchers at SSD-Disclosure published adetailed write-upalong with a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit that achieves RCE on the server without any authentication using a JSP web shell. The attacker uploads a malicious .jsp file via an unauthenticated POST request, exploiting path traversal to place it in a web-accessible location. By visiting the uploaded file with a cmd parameter, they can execute arbitrary OS commands and see the output in the browser. Arctic Wolf now reports that the CVE-2024-7399 flaw is actively exploited in attacks a few days after the PoC's release, indicating that threat actors adopted the disclosed attack method in real operations. ""Given the low barrier to exploitation and the availability of a public PoC, threat actors are likely to continue targeting this vulnerability,""warned Arctic Wolf. Another active exploitation confirmation comes from threat analystJohannes Ullrich, who reported seeing a Mirai botnet malware variant leveraging CVE-2024-7399 to take over devices. Given the active exploitation status of the flaw, it is recommended that system administrators take immediate action to patch CVE-2024-7399 by upgrading the Samsung MagicINFO Server to version 21.1050 or later. Update 5/7- There's some debase as to whether or not the flaw targeted by SSD-Disclosure's PoC is in fact CVE-2024-7399 or an unfixed zero-day vulnerability, with HuntressLabs security researchersreportingthat Samsung's download portal doesn't even offer the latest firmware version when attempting to download it from the official website.

CVE-2025-3248,2025-05-06,bleeping computer,"The U.S. Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has tagged a Langflow remote code execution vulnerability as actively exploited, urging organizations to apply security updates and mitigations as soon as possible. The vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2025-3248 and is a critical unauthenticated RCE flaw that allows any attacker on the internet to take full control of vulnerable Langflow servers by exploiting an API endpoint flaw. Langflow is an open-source visual programming tool for building LLM-powered workflows using LangChain components. It provides a drag-and-drop interface to create, test, and deploy AI agents or pipelines without writing full backend code. The tool, which has nearly 60k stars and 6.3k forks on GitHub, is used by AI developers, researchers, and startups, for prototyping chatbots, data pipelines, agent systems, and AI applications. Langflow exposes an endpoint (/api/v1/validate/code) designed to validate user-submitted code. In vulnerable versions, this endpoint does not safely sandbox or sanitize the input, allowing an attacker to send malicious code to that endpoint and have it executed directly on the server. CVE-2025-3248 was fixed inversion 1.3.0, released on April 1, 2025, so it's recommended to upgrade to that version or later to mitigate the risks that arise from the flaw. The patch wasminimal, just adding authentication for the vulnerable endpoint, involving no sandboxing or hardening. The latest Langflow version,1.4.0, was released earlier today and contains a long list of fixes, so users should upgrade to this release. Horizon3 researchers published anin-depth technical blogabout the flaw on April 9, 2025, including a proof-of-concept exploit. The researchers warned about the high likelihood of exploitation for CVE-2025-3248, identifying at least 500 internet-exposed instances at the time. Those who cannot upgrade to a safe version immediately are recommended to restrict network access to Langflow by putting it behind a firewall, authenticated reverse proxy, or VPN. Also, direct internet exposure is discouraged. CISA hasgiven federal agenciesuntil May 26, 2025, to apply the security update or mitigations or stop using the software. CISA has not provided any specific details about the observed exploitation activity and has stated that it is currently unknown whether ransomware groups are exploiting the vulnerability. For users of Langflow, it's important to bear in mind Horizon3's remarks about the tool's design, which, according to them, has poor privilege separation, no sandbox, and a history of RCEs ""by design"" stemming from its nature and intended functionality. CVE-2025-3248 is the first truly unauthenticated RCE flaw in Langflow, and given its active exploitation status, immediate action is required.

FreeType is a popular open-source font rendering library that displays and programmatically adds text to images. The flaw, tracked as CVE-2025-27363, is a high-severity arbitrary code execution bugdiscovered by Facebooksecurity researchers in March 2025. It impacts all FreeType versions up to 2.13, which was released on February 9, 2023, and addresses the vulnerability. ""There are indications that CVE-2025-27363 may be under limited, targeted exploitation,""reads the bulletin. Neither Facebook nor Google disclosed details about how the flaw is used in attacks. However,Facebook's disclosurein March explains that it can be exploited when FreeType parses a malicious TrueType GX or variable fonts file, leading to code execution. ""An out of bounds write exists in FreeType versions 2.13.0 and below (newer versions of FreeType are not vulnerable) when attempting to parse font subglyph structures related to TrueType GX and variable font files,"" reads Facebook's disclosure. ""The vulnerable code assigns a signed short value to an unsigned long and then adds a static value causing it to wrap around and allocate too small of a heap buffer. The code then writes up to 6 signed long integers out of bounds relative to this buffer. This may result in arbitrary code execution."" The rest of the flaws fixed by Google this month concern problems in Framework, System, Google Play, and the Android Kernel, as well as security gaps in proprietary components from MediaTek, Qualcomm, Arm, and Imagination Technologies. All the flaws in core Android components are rated high severity, with most being elevation of privilege problems. The released fixes concern Android versions 13, 14, and 15, though not all vulnerabilities impact all three. Android 12 reached the end of support on March 31, 2025, so it's no longer receiving security fixes. However, it (and older versions) may be impacted by some of the vulnerabilities listed in the latest bulletin. Google regularly incorporates critical fixes for those devices via the Google Play system update channel, though specific fixes to actively exploited flaws aren't guaranteed for older devices.

CVE-2021-27065,2025-05-02,bleeping computer,"A 36-year-old Yemeni national, who is believed to be the developer and primary operator of 'Black Kingdom' ransomware, has been indicted by the United States for conducting 1,500 attacks on Microsoft Exchange servers. The suspect, Rami Khaled Ahmed, is accused of deploying the Black Kingdom malware on roughly 1,500 computers in the United States and abroad, demanding ransom payments of $10,000 in Bitcoin. ""According to the indictment, from March 2021 to June 2023, Ahmed and others infected computer networks of several U.S.-based victims, including a medical billing services company in Encino, a ski resort in Oregon, a school district in Pennsylvania, and a health clinic in Wisconsin,""explains a U.S. Department of Justice announcement. ""When the malware was successful, the ransomware then created a ransom note on the victim's system that directed the victim to send $10,000 worth of Bitcoin to a cryptocurrency address controlled by a co-conspirator and to send proof of this payment to a Black Kingdom email address,"" reads another part of the announcement. The U.S. DoJ highlights that Ahmed designed Black Kingdom ransomware to exploit a vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange for initial access to targeted computers. This was first reported in March 2021 by researcherMarcus Hutchins, who discovered web shells deployed by Black Kingdom ransomware operators on Exchange servers vulnerable to ProxyLogon attacks. TheProxyLogonflaw refers to a set of critical vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server that were first disclosed and exploited in early 2021. The flaws are CVE-2021-26855 (Server-Side Request Forgery used for initial access), CVE-2021-26857 (insecure deserialization used for privilege escalation to SYSTEM), and CVE-2021-26858 and CVE-2021-27065 (arbitrary file write used for writing web shells to servers).

CVE-2025-3928,2025-04-30,bleeping computer,"Commvault, a leading provider of data protection solutions, says a nation-state threat actor who breached its Azure environment didn't gain access to customer backup data. Listed on NASDAQ since March 2006, Commvault is included in the S&P MidCap 400 Index and provides cyber resilience services to over 100,000 organizations. As the companyfirst revealed on March 7, 2025, Commvault discovered the incident after being notified by Microsoft on February 20 of suspicious activity within its Azure environment. A follow-up investigation into the breach found that the incident only affected a small number of Commvault customers and had not impacted the company's operations. ""Importantly, there has been no unauthorized access to customer backup data that Commvault stores and protects, and no material impact on our business operations or our ability to deliver products and services,"" Danielle Sheer, the company's Chief Trust Officer,said in a Wednesday update. ""We are working closely with two leading cybersecurity firms and are coordinating with the appropriate authorities, including the FBI, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and others."" In asupport documentcontaining indicators of compromise, Commvault advises customers to apply a Conditional Access policy to all Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and Azure AD single-tenant App registrations to protect their data against similar attack attempts. It also recommended to regularly monitor sign-in activity to detect access attempts originating from IP addresses outside of allowed ranges and to rotate and sync client secrets between Commvault and the Azure portal every 90 days. ""This can help quickly identify potential security breaches or account compromises. If any unauthorized access is detected, immediately report the incident to Commvault Support for further investigation and remediation,"" the company says. The company also noted in the original disclosure that the threat actors exploited a now-patched zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2025-3928) in its Commvault Web Server software that remote authenticated attackers with low privileges can exploit remotely to plant webshells on target servers. CISA has alsoadded the CVE-2025-3928 vulnerabilityto its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog on Monday, requiring federal agencies to secure their Commvault software by May 19, 2025, as mandated by the Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01 issued in November 2021.

CVE-2025-24132,2025-04-29,bleeping computer,"​A set of security vulnerabilities in Apple's AirPlay Protocol and AirPlay Software Development Kit (SDK) exposed unpatched third-party and Apple devices to various attacks, including remote code execution. According to cybersecurity company Oligo Security security researchers who discovered and reported the flaws, they can be exploited in zero-click and one-click RCE attacks, man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, and denial of service (DoS) attacks, as well as to bypass access control list (ACL) and user interaction, to gain access to sensitive information, and read arbitrary local files. In all, Oligo disclosed 23 security vulnerabilities to Apple, which released security updates to address these vulnerabilities (collectively known as ""AirBorne"") on March 31 for iPhones and iPads (iOS 18.4 and iPadOS 18.4), Macs (macOS Ventura 13.7.5,macOS Sonoma 14.7.5, andmacOS Sequoia 15.4), and Apple Vision Pro (visionOS 2.4) devices. The company also patched theAirPlay audio SDK, theAirPlay video SDK, and theCarPlay Communication Plug-in. While the AirBorne vulnerabilities can only be exploited by attackers on the same network via wireless networks or peer-to-peer connections, they allow taking over vulnerable devices and using the access as a launchpad to compromise other AirPlay-enabled devices on the same network. Oligo's security researchers said they were able to demonstrate that attackers can use two of the security flaws (CVE-2025-24252 and CVE-2025-24132) to create wormable zero-click RCE exploits. Additionally, the CVE-2025-24206 user interaction bypass flaw enables a threat actor to bypass ""Accept"" click requirements on AirPlay requests and can be chained with other flaws to launch zero-click attacks. ""This means that an attacker can take over certain AirPlay-enabled devices and do things like deploy malware that spreads to devices on any local network the infected device connects to. This could lead to the delivery of other sophisticated attacks related to espionage, ransomware, supply-chain attacks, and more,""Oligo warned. ""Because AirPlay is a fundamental piece of software for Apple devices (Mac, iPhone, iPad, AppleTV, etc.) as well as third-party devices that leverage the AirPlay SDK, this class of vulnerabilities could have far-reaching impacts."" The cybersecurity company advises organizations to immediately update any corporate Apple devices and AirPlay-enabled devices to the latest software release and ask employees to also update all their personal AirPlay devices. Additional measures users can take to reduce the attack surface include updating all their Apple devices to the latest version, disabling the AirPlay receiver if not used, restricting AirPlay access to trusted devices using firewall rules, and reducing the attack surface by only allowing AirPlay for the current user. Apple says that there areover 2.35 billion active Apple devicesaround the world (including iPhones, iPads, Macs, and others), and Oligo estimates that there are also tens of millions of third-party audio devices like speakers and TVs with AirPlay support, not including car infotainment systems with CarPlay support.

CVE-2025-1976,2025-04-29,bleeping computer,"The U.S. Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is warning of Broadcom Brocade Fabric OS, Commvault web servers, and Qualitia Active! Mail clients vulnerabilities that are actively exploited in attacks. The flaws were added yesterday to CISA's 'Known Exploited Vulnerabilities'(KEV) catalog, with the Broadcom Brocade Fabric OS and Commvault flaws not previously tagged as exploited. Broadcom Brocade Fabric OS is a specialized operating system that runs on the company's Brocade Fibre Channel switches to manage and optimize storage area networks (SAN). Earlier this month, Broadcom disclosed an arbitrary code execution flaw impacting Fabric OS versions 9.1.0 through 9.1.1d6, tracked under CVE-2025-1976. While the flaw requires admin privileges to exploit, Broadcom says it has been actively exploited in attacks. ""This vulnerability can allow the user to execute any existing Fabric OS command or can also be used to modify the Fabric OS itself, including adding their own subroutines,""reads Broadcom's bulletin. ""Even though achieving this exploit first requires valid access to a role with admin privileges, this vulnerability has been actively exploited in the field."" CVE-2025-1976 was addressed with the release of Brocade Fabric OS 9.1.1d7. The latest branch, 9.2.0, is not impacted by this vulnerability. The Commvault flaw, tracked underCVE-2025-3928, is an unspecified security problem that authenticated attackers can exploit remotely to plant webshells on target servers. Commvault web servers are user-facing and API components of a backup system used by enterprises to protect and restore critical data. Despite the requirements for authentication and exposure of the environment to the internet, the flaw is under active exploitation in the wild. CVE-2025-3928 was fixed in versions 11.36.46, 11.32.89, 11.28.141, and 11.20.217 for Windows and Linux platforms. The third flaw CISA added to KEV is CVE-2025-42599, a stack-based buffer overflow problem impacting all versions of Active! up to and including 'BuildInfo: 6.60.05008561' on all OS platforms. Active! mail is a web-based email client widely used by government, financial, and IT service organizations in Japan. The flaw wasflagged as actively exploitedlast week by Japan's CERT, while SMB providers and ISPs in the country also announced service outages caused by related exploitation activity. Qualitia addressed the problem with the release of Active! Mail 6 BuildInfo: 6.60.06008562. CISA has given impacted organizations until May 17, 2025, to apply fixes or available mitigations for CVE-2025-3928 and May 19, 2025, for the other two flaws.

CVE-2025-31324,2025-04-28,bleeping computer,"Over 1,200 internet-exposed SAP NetWeaver instances are vulnerable to an actively exploited maximum severity unauthenticated file upload vulnerability that allows attackers to hijack servers. SAP NetWeaver is an application server and development platform that runs and connects SAP and non-SAP applications across different technologies. Last week, SAP disclosed an unauthenticated file upload vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-31324, in SAP NetWeaver Visual Composer, specifically the Metadata Uploader component. The flaw allows remote attackers to upload arbitrary executable files on exposed instances without authenticating, achieving code execution and full system compromise. Multiple cybersecurity firms, including ReliaQuest, watchTowr, and Onapsis, confirmed the flaw isactively exploited in attacks, with threat actors utilizing it to drop web shells on vulnerable servers. A SAP spokesperson told BleepingComputer that they were aware of these attempts and released a workaround on April 8, 2024, followed by a security update that addressed CVE-2025-31324 on April 25. SAP told BleepingComputer that they are not aware of any cases where these attacks impacted customer data or systems. Researchers have now confirmed that many vulnerable SAP Netweaver servers are exposed on the internet, making them prime targets for attacks. TheShadowserver Foundationfound the427 exposed servers, warning of the massive exposed attack surface and the potentially severe repercussions of exploitation. Most of the vulnerable systems (149) are in the United States, followed by India (50), Australia (37), China (31), Germany (30), the Netherlands (13), Brazil (10), and France (10). However, cyber defense search engineOnyphepaints a more dire picture, telling BleepingComputer that there are 1,284 vulnerable servers exposed online, with 474 already having been compromised with webshells. ""Something like 20 Fortune 500/Global 500 companies are vulnerable, and many of them are compromised,"" Onyphe CTO Patrice Auffret told BleepingComputer. Researchers reported that the threat actors are utilizing webshells with names like, ""cache.jsp"" and ""helper.jsp."" Howver,Nextron Research saysthey are also using random names, making it more difficult to find vulnerable Netweaver instances. While the number of servers is not massive, the risk is still significant, given that large enterprises and multinational corporations commonly use SAP NetWeaver. To address the risk, it is recommended that the latest security update be applied by following the vendor's instructions inthis bulletin. If unable to apply the update, the below mitigations are recommended: RedRays has also released ascanner tool for CVE-2025-31324that can help pinpoint risks in large environments. BleepingComputer contacted SAP with further questions about the active exploitation and will update the story with any response.

CVE-2025-21204,2025-04-25,bleeping computer,"A recent Windows security update that creates an ‘inetpub’ folder has introduced a new weakness allowing attackers to prevent the installation of future updates. After people installed this month'sMicrosoft Patch Tuesdaysecurity updates, Windows userssuddenly found an ""inetpub"" folderowned by the SYSTEM account created in the root of the system drive, normally the C: drive. It was strange to see this folder created as it is normally used to hold files associated with Microsoft's Internet Information Service web server, which was not installed on these devices. In an update to asecurity advisory, Microsoft later confirmed that the C:\inetpub folder was part of a fix for a Windows Process Activation elevation of privilege vulnerability tracked as CVE-2025-21204, with the companywarning not to delete the folder. ""After installing the updates listed in the Security Updates table for your operating system, a new %systemdrive%\inetpub folder will be created on your device,""confirmed Microsoft. ""This folder should not be deleted regardless of whether Internet Information Services (IIS) is active on the target device. This behavior is part of changes that increase protection and does not require any action from IT admins and end users."" However, cybersecurity expert Kevin Beaumont has demonstrated that this folder can be abused to prevent further Windows updates from being installed if it is created a certain way. ""I've discovered this fix introduces a denial of service vulnerability in the Windows servicing stack that allows non-admin users to stop all future Windows security updates,"" Kevin Beaumont. In a new report,Beaumont saysthat Windows users, even those without administrative privileges, can create a junction between C:\inetpub and a Windows file, like C:\windows\system32\notepad.exe using the following command. A Windows junction is a special type of folder that redirects access to another folder on the same or another drive, making it appear as though the content exists in both locations. When asked why this junction is preventing the update from being installed, Beaumont says he believes it's because the update expects a folder rather than a file. ""It works with basically any file, I think it's because the servicing stack expects c:\inetpub to be a directory - but mklink allows you to make a junction to a file,"" Beaumont told BleepingComputer. According toMicrosoft's documentation, junctions are meant to be links between folders rather than between files. However, as you can see from the image earlier in the article, it is still possible to create one as shown in the image below. With this junction created, if you attempt to install the April security update, it will not install correctly, giving a0x800F081F error code. This code is related to the error ""CBS_E_SOURCE_MISSING,"" which means a package or file was not found. Beaumont says he reported the bug to Microsoft, who has assigned it a ""Medium"" severity classification and closed his case, stating they will consider fixing it in the future. ""After careful investigation, this case is currently rated as a Moderate severity issue,""Microsoft emailed Beaumont. ""It does not meet MSRCs current bar for immediate servicing as the update fails to apply only if the 'inetpub' folder is a junction to a file and succeeds upon deleting the inetpub symlink and retrying."" BleepingComputer also contacted Microsoft about this bug on Wednesday but has not received a response yet. Based on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.
