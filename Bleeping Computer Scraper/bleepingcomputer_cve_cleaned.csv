CVE-2025-2783,2025-05-16,bleeping computer,"On Thursday, CISA warned U.S. federal agencies to secure their systems against ongoing attacks exploiting a high-severity vulnerability in the Chrome web browser. Solidlab security researcher Vsevolod Kokorin discovered the flaw (CVE-2025-4664) and shared technical details online on May 5th. Googlereleased security updatesto patch it on Wednesday. As Kokorin explained, the vulnerability isdueto insufficient policy enforcement in Google Chrome's Loader component, and successful exploitation can allow remote attackers to leak cross-origin data via maliciously crafted HTML pages. ""You probably know that unlike other browsers, Chrome resolves the Link header on subresource requests. But what's the problem? The issue is that the Link header can set a referrer-policy. We can specify unsafe-url and capture the full query parameters,""Kokorin noted. ""Query parameters can contain sensitive data - for example, in OAuth flows, this might lead to an Account Takeover. Developers rarely consider the possibility of stealing query parameters via an image from a 3rd-party resource."" While Google didn't disclose if the vulnerability was previously abused in attacks or if it's still being exploited, it warned in a security advisory that it has a public exploit, which is how it usually hints at active exploitation. One day later,CISA confirmedCVE-2025-4664 is being abused in the wild and added it to theKnown Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog, which lists security flaws actively exploited in attacks. As mandated by the November 2021 Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01, U.S. Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies must patch their Chrome installation within three weeks, by May 7th, to secure their systems against potential breaches. While this directive only applies to federal agencies, all network defenders are advised to prioritize patching this vulnerability as soon as possible. ""These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise,"" the cybersecurity agency warned. This is the second actively exploited Chrome zero-day patched by Google this year, afteranother high-severity Chrome zero-daybug (CVE-2025-2783), which was abused to target Russian government organizations, media outlets, and educational institutions in cyber-espionage attacks.

CVE-2022-2601,2025-05-14,bleeping computer,"Microsoft has fixed a known issue preventing Linux from booting on dual-boot systems with Secure Boot enabled after installing the August 2024 Windows security updates. The list of affected systems includes those running client (Windows 10 and Windows 11) and server (Windows Server 2012 and later) OS versions. This issue is triggered by a Secure Boot Advanced Targeting (SBAT) update that blocksUEFI shim bootloadersvulnerable to exploits targeting theCVE-2022-2601GRUB2 Secure Boot bypass. While Microsoft said in the CVE-2022-2601 advisory that this SBAT update would not be delivered to devices where dual booting is detected, it also acknowledged that the dual-boot detection failed to detect some customized methods of dual-booting and applied the update anyway.

Microsoftconfirmed the known issuefollowing widespread reports, saying that affected users saw ""Something has gone seriously wrong: SBAT self-check failed: Security Policy Violation"" errors on systems rendered unbootable. This week, nine months after confirming the issue, Microsoft announced that the May 2025 Patch Tuesday security updates should fix the boot problems for all affected users.

CVE-2025-32756,2025-05-13,bleeping computer,"Fortinet released security updates to patch a critical remote code execution vulnerability exploited as a zero-day in attacks targeting FortiVoice enterprise phone systems. The security flaw is a stack-based overflow vulnerability tracked asCVE-2025-32756that also impacts FortiMail, FortiNDR, FortiRecorder, and FortiCamera. As the company explains in a security advisory issued on Tuesday, successful exploitation can allow remote unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code or commands via maliciously crafted HTTP requests. Fortinet's Product Security Team discovered CVE-2025-32756 based on attackers' activity, including network scans, system crashlogs deletion to cover their tracks, and 'fcgi debugging' being toggled on to log credentials from the system or SSH login attempts. As detailed in today's security advisory, the threat actors have launched attacks from half a dozen IP addresses, including 198.105.127[.]124, 43.228.217[.]173, 43.228.217[.]82, 156.236.76[.]90, 218.187.69[.]244, and 218.187.69[.]59. Indicators of compromise spotted by Fortinet during the attacks' analysis include the 'fcgi debugging' setting (which isn't toggled on by default), enabled on compromised systems. To check if this setting is turned on on your system, you should see ""general to-file ENABLED"" after running the following command:diag debug application fcgi. While investigating these attacks, Fortinet has observed the threat actors deploying malware on hacked devices, adding cron jobs designed to harvest credentials, and dropping scripts to scan the victims' networks. The company also shared mitigation advice for customers who can't immediately install today's security updates, which requires them to disable the HTTP/HTTPS administrative interface on vulnerable devices. Last month, the Shadowserver Foundationdiscovered over 16,000 internet-exposed Fortinet devicescompromised using a new symlink backdoor that provides threat actors with read-only access to sensitive files on now-patched devices hacked in previous attacks.

CVE-2024-45332,2025-05-13,bleeping computer,"A new ""Branch Privilege Injection"" flaw in all modern Intel CPUs allows attackers to leak sensitive data from memory regions allocated to privileged software like the operating system kernel. Typically, these regions are populated with information like passwords, cryptographic keys, memory of other processes, and kernel data structures, so protecting them from leakage is crucial. According toETH Zurich researchersSandro Rüegge, Johannes Wikner, and Kaveh Razavi, Spectre v2 mitigations held for six years, but their latest ""Branch Predictor Race Conditions"" exploit effectively bypasses them. The flaw, which is named 'branch privilege injection' and tracked underCVE-2024-45332, is a race condition on the subsystem of branch predictors used in Intel CPUs. Branch predictors like Branch Target Buffer (BTB) and Indirect Branch Predictor (IBP) are specialized hardware components that try to guess the outcome of a branch instruction before it's resolved to keep the CPU pipeline full for optimal performance. These predictions are speculative, meaning they are undone if they end up being wrong. However, if they are correct, it increases performance. The researchers found that Intel's branch predictor updates are not synchronized with instruction execution, resulting in these updates traversing privilege boundaries. If a privilege switch happens, like from user mode to kernel mode, there is a small window of opportunity during which the update is associated with the wrong privilege level. As a result, isolation between user and kernel is broken, and a non-privileged user can leak data from privileged processes. ETH Zurich's team developed an exploit that trains the CPU to predict a specific branch target, then makes a system call to move execution into the OS kernel, leading to speculative execution using the attacker-controlled target (""gadget""). This code accesses secret data loaded into the cache, and using a side-channel method, the contents are leaked to the attacker. The researchers demonstrated their attack on Ubuntu 24.04 with default mitigations enabled to read the contents of the '/etc/shadow/' file containing hashed account passwords. The exploit can achieve peak leak rates of 5.6 KB/sec at 99.8% accuracy. CVE-2024-45332 impacts all Intel CPUs from the ninth generation onward, including Coffee Lake, Comet Lake, Rocket Lake, Alder Lake, and Raptor Lake. ""All intel processors since the 9th generation (Coffee Lake Refresh) are affected by Branch Privilege Injection,"" explains the researchers. ""However, we have observed predictions bypassing the Indirect Branch Prediction Barrier (IBPB) on processors as far back as 7th generation (Kaby Lake)."" ETH Zurich researchers did not test older generations at this time, but since they do not support Enhanced Indirect Branch Restricted Speculation (eIBRS), they're less relevant to this specific exploit and likely more prone to older Spectre v2-like attacks. Arm Cortex-X1, Cortex-A76, and AMD Zen 5 and Zen 4 chips were also examined, but they do not exhibit the same asynchronous predictor behavior, so they are not vulnerable to CVE-2024-45332. Although the attack was demonstrated on Linux, the flaw is present on the hardware level, so it's theoretically exploitable on Windows too. The researchers reported their findings to Intel in September 2024, and the tech giant released microcode updates that mitigate CVE-2024-45332 on impacted models. The firmware-level mitigations introduce a 2.7% performance overhead, while software mitigations have a performance impact between 1.6% and 8.3%, depending on the CPU. The risk is low for regular users, and attacks have multiple strong prerequisites to open up realistic exploitation scenarios. That being said, applying the latest BIOS/UEFI and OS updates is recommended. ETH Zurich will present the full details of their exploit in a technical paper at the upcomingUSENIX Security 2025. Update 5/13 -Intel published asecurity bulletin about CVE-2024-45332and also sent BleepingComputer the below comment: “We appreciate the work done by ETH Zurich on this research and collaboration on coordinated public disclosure.

CVE-2025-3462,2025-05-12,bleeping computer,"The ASUS DriverHub driver management utility was vulnerable to a critical remote code execution flaw that allowed malicious sites to execute commands on devices with the software installed. The flaw was discovered by an independent cybersecurity researcher from New Zealand named Paul (aka ""MrBruh""), who found that the software had poor validation of commands sent to the DriverHub background service. This allowed the researcher to create an exploit chain utilizing flaws tracked asCVE-2025-3462andCVE-2025-3463that, when combined, achieve origin bypass and trigger remote code execution on the target. DriverHub is ASUS's official driver management tool that is automatically installed on the first system boot when utilizing certain ASUS motherboards. This software runs in the background, automatically detecting and fetching the latest driver versions for the detected motherboard model and its chipset. Once installed, the tool remains active and running in the background via a local service on port 53000, continually checking for important driver updates. Meanwhile, most users don't even know such a service is constantly running on their system. That service checks the Origin Header of incoming HTTP requests to reject anything that doesn't come from 'driverhub.asus.com.' However, this check is poorly implemented, as any site that includes that string is accepted even if it's not an exact match to ASUS's official portal. The second issue lies in the UpdateApp endpoint, which allows DriverHub to download and run .exe files from "".asus.com"" URLs without user confirmation. An attacker can target any user with ASUS DriverHub running on their system to trick them into visiting a malicious website on their browser. This website then sends ""UpdateApp requests"" to the local service at 'http://127.0.0.1:53000.' By spoofing the Origin Header to something like 'driverhub.asus.com.mrbruh.com,' the weak validation check is bypassed, so DriverHub accepts the commands. In the researcher's demonstration, the commands order the software to download a legitimate ASUS-signed 'AsusSetup.exe' installer from the vendor's download portal, along with a malicious .ini file and .exe payload. The ASUS-signed installer is silently run as admin and uses the configuration information in the .ini file. This ini file directs the legitimate ASUS driver installer to launch the malicious executable file. The attack is also made possible by the tool failing to delete files that fail signature checks, like the .ini and payload, which are kept on the host after their download. ASUS received the researcher's reports on April 8, 2025, and implemented a fix on April 18, after validating it with MrBruh the day before. The hardware giant did not offer the researcher any bounty for his disclosure. The CVE descriptions, which the Taiwanese vendor submitted, somewhat downplays the issue with the following statement: ""This issue is limited to motherboards and does not affect laptops, desktop computers, or other endpoints,"" reads the CVE description. This is confusing, as the mentioned CVEs impact laptops and desktop computers with DriverHub installed. However, ASUS is clearer in its security bulletin, advising users to quickly apply the latest update. ""This update includes important security updates and ASUS strongly recommends that users update their ASUS DriverHub installation to the latest version,""reads the bulletin. ""The latest Software Update can be accessed by opening ASUS DriverHub, then clicking the ""Update Now"" button."" MrBruh says he monitored certificate transparency updates and found no other TLS certificates containing the ""driverhub.asus.com"" string, indicating it was not exploited in the wild.

CVE-2025-27920,2025-05-12,bleeping computer,"A Türkiye-backed cyberespionage group exploited a zero-day vulnerability to attack Output Messenger users linked to the Kurdish military in Iraq. Microsoft Threat Intelligence analysts who spotted these attacks also discovered the security flaw (CVE-2025-27920) in the LAN messaging application, a directory traversal vulnerability that can let authenticated attackers access sensitive files outside the intended directory or deploy malicious payloads on the server's startup folder. ""Attackers could access files such as configuration files, sensitive user data, or even source code, and depending on the file contents, this could lead to further exploitation, including remote code execution,"" Srimax, the app's developer,explainsin a security advisory issued in December when the bug was patched with the release of Output Messenger V2.0.63. Microsoft revealed on Monday that the hacking group (also tracked as Sea Turtle, SILICON, and UNC1326) targeted users who hadn't updated their systems to infect them with malware after gaining access to the Output Messenger Server Manager application. After compromising the server, Marbled Dust hackers could steal sensitive data, access all user communications, impersonate users, gain access to internal systems, and cause operational disruptions. ""While we currently do not have visibility into how Marbled Dust gained authentication in each instance, we assess that the threat actor leverages DNS hijacking or typo-squatted domains to intercept, log, and reuse credentials, as these are techniques leveraged by Marbled Dust in previously observed malicious activity,""Microsoft said. Next, the attackers deployed a backdoor (OMServerService.exe)onto the victims' devices, which checked connectivity against an attacker-controlled command-and-control domain (api.wordinfos[.]com) and then provided the threat actors with additional information to identify each victim. ​In one instance, the Output Messenger client on a victim's device connected to an IP address linked to the Marbled Dust threat group, likely for data exfiltration, shortly after the attacker instructed the malware to collect files and archive them as a RAR archive. Marbled Dust is known for targeting Europe and the Middle East, focusing on telecommunications and IT companies, as well as government institutions and organizations opposing the Turkish government. To breach the networks of infrastructure providers, they're scanning for vulnerabilities in internet-facing devices. They're also exploiting their access to compromised DNS registries to change government organizations' DNS server configurations, which allows them to intercept traffic and steal credentials in man-in-the-middle attacks. ""This new attack signals a notable shift in Marbled Dust's capability while maintaining consistency in their overall approach,"" Microsoft added. ""The successful use of a zero-day exploit suggests an increase in technical sophistication and could also suggest that Marbled Dust's targeting priorities have escalated or that their operational goals have become more urgent."" Last year, Marbled Dust was alsolinked to multiple espionage campaignstargeting organizations in the Netherlands, mainly targeting telecommunications companies, internet service providers (ISPs), and Kurdish websites between 2021 and 2023.

CVE-2025-31324,2025-05-09,bleeping computer,"Forescout Vedere Labs security researchers have linked ongoing attacks targeting a maximum severity vulnerability impacting SAP NetWeaver instances to a Chinese threat actor. SAPreleased an out-of-band emergency patchon April 24 to address this unauthenticated file upload security flaw (tracked asCVE-2025-31324) in SAP NetWeaver Visual Composer, days after cybersecurity companyReliaQuestfirst detected the vulnerability being targeted in attacks. Successful exploitation enables unauthenticated attackers to upload malicious files without logging in, allowing them to gain remote code execution and potentially leading to complete system compromise. ReliaQuest reported that multiple customers' systems were breached through unauthorized file uploads on SAP NetWeaver, with the threat actors uploading JSP web shells to public directories, as well as the Brute Ratel red team tool in the post-exploitation phase of their attacks. The compromised SAP NetWeaver servers were fully patched, indicating that the attackers used a zero-day exploit. This exploitation activity was also confirmed by other cybersecurity firms, including watchTowr andOnapsis, who also confirmed the attackers were uploading web shell backdoors on unpatched instances exposed online. Mandiantalso observedCVE-2025-31324 zero-day attacks dating back to at least mid-March 2025, while Onapsis updated its original report to say its honeypot first captured reconnaissance activity and payload testing since January 20, with exploitation attempts starting on February 10. The Shadowserver Foundation is nowtracking 204 SAP Netweaver serversexposed online and vulnerable to CVE-2025-31324 attacks. Onyphe CTO Patrice Auffret also told BleepingComputer in late April that ""Something like 20 Fortune 500/Global 500 companies are vulnerable, and many of them are compromised,"" adding that at the time, there were 1,284 vulnerable instances exposed online, 474 of which were already compromised. More recent attacks on April 29 have been linked to a Chinese threat actor tracked byForescout's Vedere Labsas Chaya_004. These attacks were launched from IP addresses using anomalous self-signed certificates impersonating Cloudflare, many of them belonging to Chinese cloud providers (e.g., Alibaba, Shenzhen Tencent, Huawei Cloud Service, and China Unicom). The attacker also deployed Chinese-language tools during the breaches, including a web-based reverse shell (SuperShell) developed by a Chinese-speaking developer. ""As part of our investigation into active exploitation of this vulnerability, we uncovered malicious infrastructure likely belonging to a Chinese threat actor, which we are currently tracking as Chaya_004 – following our convention for unnamed threat actors,"" Forescout said. ""The infrastructure includes a network of servers hosting Supershell backdoors, often deployed on Chinese cloud providers, and various pen testing tools, many of Chinese origin."" SAP admins are advised to immediately patch their NetWeaver instances, restrict access to metadata uploader services, monitor for suspicious activity on their servers, and consider disabling the Visual Composer service if possible. CISA has alsoaddedthe CVE-2025-31324 security flaw to itsKnown Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalogone week ago, ordering U.S. federal agencies to secure their systems against these attacks by May 20, as required byBinding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01. ""These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise,"" CISA warned.

CVE-2025-20188,2025-05-08,bleeping computer,"Cisco has fixed a maximum severity flaw in IOS XE Software for Wireless LAN Controllers by a hard-coded JSON Web Token (JWT) that allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to take over devices. This token is meant to authenticate requests to a feature called 'Out-of-Band AP Image Download.' Since it's hard-coded, anyone can impersonate an authorized user without credentials. The vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2025-20188 and has a maximum 10.0 CVSS score, allowing threat actors to fully compromise devices according to the vendor. ""An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTPS requests to the AP image download interface,""reads Cisco's bulletin. ""A successful exploit could allow the attacker to upload files, perform path traversal, and execute arbitrary commands with root privileges."" It is noted that CVE-2025-20188 is only exploitable when the 'Out-of-Band AP Image Download' feature is enabled on the device, which isn't enabled by default. The 'Out-of-Band AP Image Download' feature allows access points (APs) to download OS images via HTTPS rather than over the CAPWAP protocol, allowing a more flexible and direct way to get firmware onto APs. That said, although it's disabled by default, some large-scale or automated enterprise deployments may enable it for faster provisioning or recovery of APs. The following devices are vulnerable to attacks if the exploitation requirements are met: On the other hand, products confirmed not to be impacted by the hard-coded JWT issue are: Cisco IOS (non-XE), Cisco IOS XR, Cisco Meraki products, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco AireOS-based WLCs. Cisco has released security updates to address the critical vulnerability, so system administrators are advised to apply them as soon as possible. Users can determine the exact version that fixes the flaw for their device using the Cisco Software Checker for their specific device model. Although there are no mitigations or workarounds for CVE-2025-20188, disabling the 'Out-of-Band AP Image Download' feature is a solid defense. At this time, Cisco is unaware of any cases of active exploitation for CVE-2025-20188. However, given the severity of the issue, threat actors are likely to start scanning for exposed vulnerable endpoints immediately.

CVE-2025-29824,2025-05-07,bleeping computer,"The Play ransomware gang has exploited a high-severity Windows Common Log File System flaw in zero-day attacks to gain SYSTEM privileges and deploy malware on compromised systems. The vulnerability, tracked asCVE-2025-29824, was tagged by Microsoft as exploited in a limited number of attacks and patched duringlast month's Patch Tuesday. ""The targets include organizations in the information technology (IT) and real estate sectors of the United States, the financial sector in Venezuela, a Spanish software company, and the retail sector in Saudi Arabia,""Microsoft said in April. Microsoft linked these attacks to the RansomEXX ransomware gang, saying the attackers installed the PipeMagic backdoor malware, which was used to drop the CVE-2025-29824 exploit, deploy ransomware payloads, and ransom notes after encrypting files. Since then, Symantec's Threat Hunter Team has also found evidence linking them to the Play ransomware-as-a-service operation, saying the attackers deployed a CVE-2025-29824 zero-day privilege escalation exploit after breaching a U.S. organization's network. ""Although no ransomware payload was deployed in the intrusion, the attackers deployed the Grixba infostealer, which is a custom tool associated with Balloonfly, the attackers behind the Play ransomware operation,""Symantec said. ""Balloonfly is a cybercrime group that has been active since at least June 2022 and uses the Play ransomware (also known as PlayCrypt) in attacks."" The Grixba custom network-scanning and information-stealing toolwas first spotted two years ago, and Play ransomware operators typically use it to enumerate users and computers in compromised networks. The Play cybercrime gang surfaced in June 2022 and is also known for double-extortion attacks, in which its affiliates pressure victims into paying ransoms to avoid having their stolen data leaked online. In December 2023, the FBIissued a joint advisorywith CISA and the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), warning that the Play ransomware gang had breached the networks of around 300 organizations worldwide as of October 2023. Previous notable Play ransomware victims include cloud computing companyRackspace, car retailer giantArnold Clark, theCity of Oaklandin California,Dallas County, theBelgian city of Antwerp, and, more recently, American semiconductor supplierMicrochip Technologyanddoughnut chain Krispy Kreme.

CVE-2019-3568,2025-05-07,bleeping computer,"A U.S. federal jury has ordered Israeli spyware vendor NSO Group to pay WhatsApp $167,254,000 in punitive damages and $444,719 in compensatory damages for a 2019 campaign that targeted 1,400 users of the communication app. The verdict is considered a landmark case for being the first time a spyware vendor is held accountable in court, and could send ripples across the commercial spyware industry. ""Today's verdict in WhatsApp's case is an important step forward for privacy and security as the first victory against the development and use of illegal spyware that threatens the safety and privacy of everyone,"" commented Meta, WhatsApp's owner, inan announcement. ""Today, the jury's decision to force NSO, a notorious foreign spyware merchant, to pay damages is a critical deterrent to this malicious industry against their illegal acts aimed at American companies and the privacy and security of the people we serve."" The fines stem from a May 2019 campaign when NSO attempted to infect 1,400 WhatsApp users with its Pegasus spyware using a WhatsApp zero-day vulnerability. It was later revealed that the vulnerability NSO leveraged during this operation wasCVE-2019-3568, a buffer overflow in the WhatsApp VOIP stack, allowing attackers to send specially crafted RTCP packets to a target phone number to achieveremote code execution. When recipients received these calls, even if they did not answer, the vulnerability was automatically exploited, allowing Pegasus to be installed on devices. Meta filed the lawsuit against NSO Group on October 29, 2019, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that NSO had exploited a vulnerability in WhatsApp's calling feature to deliver its Pegasus spyware to approximately 1,400 users. Although NSO Group claims that its products are used by law enforcement tackling serious crime, Meta confirmed that the targets included human rights activists, journalists, and diplomats. The trial that included NSO executives' testimonies revealed that the spyware vendor is directly involved in infection operations, so they have direct liability. Also, they were forced to admit they spent tens of millions in USD to develop multiple infection channels besides WhatsApp. Court documentsalso revealedthat the NSO Group used at least one more zero-day vulnerability in WhatsApp software to target users with spyware even after Meta's lawsuit had been submitted. On December 23, 2024, Judge Phyllis J. Hamiltonruledthat NSO Group is liable for violating U.S. hacking laws and WhatsApp's Terms of Service, granting partial summary judgment in WhatsApp's favor and moving the case to a jury trial to determine damages. Finally, WhatsApp was awarded punitive damage compensation of $167,254,000, plus an extra $444,719 compensation for the incident investigation, vulnerability patching, and user notification. CitizenLab researcher John Scott-Railton welcomed the court's decision andwarned spyware firmsthey could be next.

CVE-2025-26647,2025-05-07,bleeping computer,"Microsoft says the April 2025 security updates are causing authentication issues on some Windows Server 2025 domain controllers. The list of impacted platforms includes Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2022, and the latest version, Windows Server 2025. However, as the company further explained, home users are unlikely to be affected by this known issue since domain controllers are typically used for business and enterprise authentication. ""After installing the April Windows monthly security update released April 8, 2025 (KB5055523) or later, Active Directory Domain Controllers (DC) might experience issues when processing Kerberos logons or delegations using certificate-based credentials that rely on key trust via the Active Directory msds-KeyCredentialLink field,"" Microsoft said in a Windows release health update. ""This can result in authentication issues in Windows Hello for Business (WHfB) Key Trust environments or environments that have deployed Device Public Key Authentication (also known as Machine PKINIT)."" These problems could also impact software relying on these two features for authentication, including but not limited to third-party single sign-on (SSO) solutions, identity management systems, and smart card authentication products. Affected auth protocols include Kerberos Public Key Cryptography for Initial Authentication (Kerberos PKINIT) and Certificate-based Service-for-User Delegation (S4U) via Kerberos Resource-Based Constrained Delegation (RBKCD or A2DF Delegation) or Kerberos Constrained Delegation (KCD or A2D2 Delegation).

""An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could be assigned much greater rights by the Key Distribution Center to the certificate than intended,"" Redmond explains. ""An authenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by obtaining a certificate containing the target Subject Key Identifier (SKI) value from a Certificate Authority (CA). The attacker could then use this certificate to get a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) for the target user from the Key Distribution Center (KDC).""

CVE-2025-30065,2025-05-06,bleeping computer,"A proof-of-concept exploit tool has been publicly released for a maximum severity Apache Parquet vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-30065, making it easy to find vulnerable servers. The tool was released by F5 Labs researchers who investigated the vulnerability after finding that multiple existing PoCs were either weak or completely non-functional. The tool serves as proof of CVE-2025-30065's practical exploitability and can also help administrators evaluate their environments and secure servers. Apache Parquet is an open-source, columnar storage format designed for efficient data processing, widely used by big data platforms and organizations engaged in data engineering and analytics. The flaw was first disclosed on April 1, 2025, following an earlier discovery by Amazon researcher Keyi Li. It was categorized as a remote code execution impacting all versions of Apache Parquet up to and including 1.15.0. From a technical perspective, CVE-2025-30065 is a deserialization flaw in the parquet-avro module of Apache Parquet Java, where the library fails to restrict which Java classes can be instantiated when reading Avro data embedded in Parquet files. On April 2, 2025,Endor Labspublished a write-up warning about the risk of exploitation and its potential impact on systems that import Parquet files from external points. Subsequent analysis by F5 Labs shows that the flaw is not a full deserialization RCE but can still be misused if a class has side effects during instantiation, like when making a network request from the vulnerable system to an attacker-controlled server. However, the researchers concluded that practical exploitation is difficult, and CVE-2025-30065 has limited value to attackers. ""While Parquet and Avro are used widely, this issue requires a specific set of circumstances that isn't all that likely in general,""reads the F5 Labs report. ""Even then, this CVE only allows attackers to trigger the instantiation of a Java object which then must have a side effect that is useful for the attacker."" Despite the low likelihood of exploitation, the researchers admit that some organizations process Parquet files from external, often unverified sources, and hence the risk is significant in some environments. For this reason, F5 Labs created a ""canary exploit"" tool (available on GitHub) that triggers an HTTP GET request via instantiation of javax.swing.JEditorKit, allowing users to verify exposure. Besides using the tool, it is recommended to upgrade to Apache Parquet version 15.1.1 or later, and configure 'org.apache.parquet.avro.SERIALIZABLE_PACKAGES' to restrict which packages are allowed for deserialization. Based on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.

CVE-2024-7399,2025-05-06,bleeping computer,"Hackers are exploiting an unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in the Samsung MagicINFO 9 Server to hijack devices and deploy malware. Samsung MagicINFO Server is a centralized content management system (CMS) used to remotely manage and control digital signage displays made by Samsung. It is used by retail stores, airports, hospitals, corporate buildings, and restaurants, where there's a need to schedule, distribute, display, and monitor multimedia content. The server component features a file upload functionality intended for updating display content, but hackers are abusing it to upload malicious code. The flaw, tracked underCVE-2024-7399, was first publiclydisclosed in August 2024when it was fixed as part of the release of version 21.1050. The vendor described the vulnerability as an ""Improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory vulnerability in Samsung MagicINFO 9 Server [that] allows attackers to write arbitrary file as system authority."" On April 30, 2025, security researchers at SSD-Disclosure published adetailed write-upalong with a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit that achieves RCE on the server without any authentication using a JSP web shell. The attacker uploads a malicious .jsp file via an unauthenticated POST request, exploiting path traversal to place it in a web-accessible location. By visiting the uploaded file with a cmd parameter, they can execute arbitrary OS commands and see the output in the browser. Arctic Wolf now reports that the CVE-2024-7399 flaw is actively exploited in attacks a few days after the PoC's release, indicating that threat actors adopted the disclosed attack method in real operations. ""Given the low barrier to exploitation and the availability of a public PoC, threat actors are likely to continue targeting this vulnerability,""warned Arctic Wolf. Another active exploitation confirmation comes from threat analystJohannes Ullrich, who reported seeing a Mirai botnet malware variant leveraging CVE-2024-7399 to take over devices. Given the active exploitation status of the flaw, it is recommended that system administrators take immediate action to patch CVE-2024-7399 by upgrading the Samsung MagicINFO Server to version 21.1050 or later. Update 5/7- There's some debase as to whether or not the flaw targeted by SSD-Disclosure's PoC is in fact CVE-2024-7399 or an unfixed zero-day vulnerability, with HuntressLabs security researchersreportingthat Samsung's download portal doesn't even offer the latest firmware version when attempting to download it from the official website.

CVE-2025-3248,2025-05-06,bleeping computer,"The U.S. Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has tagged a Langflow remote code execution vulnerability as actively exploited, urging organizations to apply security updates and mitigations as soon as possible. The vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2025-3248 and is a critical unauthenticated RCE flaw that allows any attacker on the internet to take full control of vulnerable Langflow servers by exploiting an API endpoint flaw. Langflow is an open-source visual programming tool for building LLM-powered workflows using LangChain components. It provides a drag-and-drop interface to create, test, and deploy AI agents or pipelines without writing full backend code. The tool, which has nearly 60k stars and 6.3k forks on GitHub, is used by AI developers, researchers, and startups, for prototyping chatbots, data pipelines, agent systems, and AI applications. Langflow exposes an endpoint (/api/v1/validate/code) designed to validate user-submitted code. In vulnerable versions, this endpoint does not safely sandbox or sanitize the input, allowing an attacker to send malicious code to that endpoint and have it executed directly on the server. CVE-2025-3248 was fixed inversion 1.3.0, released on April 1, 2025, so it's recommended to upgrade to that version or later to mitigate the risks that arise from the flaw. The patch wasminimal, just adding authentication for the vulnerable endpoint, involving no sandboxing or hardening. The latest Langflow version,1.4.0, was released earlier today and contains a long list of fixes, so users should upgrade to this release. Horizon3 researchers published anin-depth technical blogabout the flaw on April 9, 2025, including a proof-of-concept exploit. The researchers warned about the high likelihood of exploitation for CVE-2025-3248, identifying at least 500 internet-exposed instances at the time. Those who cannot upgrade to a safe version immediately are recommended to restrict network access to Langflow by putting it behind a firewall, authenticated reverse proxy, or VPN. Also, direct internet exposure is discouraged. CISA hasgiven federal agenciesuntil May 26, 2025, to apply the security update or mitigations or stop using the software. CISA has not provided any specific details about the observed exploitation activity and has stated that it is currently unknown whether ransomware groups are exploiting the vulnerability. For users of Langflow, it's important to bear in mind Horizon3's remarks about the tool's design, which, according to them, has poor privilege separation, no sandbox, and a history of RCEs ""by design"" stemming from its nature and intended functionality. CVE-2025-3248 is the first truly unauthenticated RCE flaw in Langflow, and given its active exploitation status, immediate action is required.

FreeType is a popular open-source font rendering library that displays and programmatically adds text to images. The flaw, tracked as CVE-2025-27363, is a high-severity arbitrary code execution bugdiscovered by Facebooksecurity researchers in March 2025. It impacts all FreeType versions up to 2.13, which was released on February 9, 2023, and addresses the vulnerability. ""There are indications that CVE-2025-27363 may be under limited, targeted exploitation,""reads the bulletin. Neither Facebook nor Google disclosed details about how the flaw is used in attacks. However,Facebook's disclosurein March explains that it can be exploited when FreeType parses a malicious TrueType GX or variable fonts file, leading to code execution. ""An out of bounds write exists in FreeType versions 2.13.0 and below (newer versions of FreeType are not vulnerable) when attempting to parse font subglyph structures related to TrueType GX and variable font files,"" reads Facebook's disclosure. ""The vulnerable code assigns a signed short value to an unsigned long and then adds a static value causing it to wrap around and allocate too small of a heap buffer. The code then writes up to 6 signed long integers out of bounds relative to this buffer. This may result in arbitrary code execution."" The rest of the flaws fixed by Google this month concern problems in Framework, System, Google Play, and the Android Kernel, as well as security gaps in proprietary components from MediaTek, Qualcomm, Arm, and Imagination Technologies. All the flaws in core Android components are rated high severity, with most being elevation of privilege problems. The released fixes concern Android versions 13, 14, and 15, though not all vulnerabilities impact all three. Android 12 reached the end of support on March 31, 2025, so it's no longer receiving security fixes. However, it (and older versions) may be impacted by some of the vulnerabilities listed in the latest bulletin. Google regularly incorporates critical fixes for those devices via the Google Play system update channel, though specific fixes to actively exploited flaws aren't guaranteed for older devices.

CVE-2021-27065,2025-05-02,bleeping computer,"A 36-year-old Yemeni national, who is believed to be the developer and primary operator of 'Black Kingdom' ransomware, has been indicted by the United States for conducting 1,500 attacks on Microsoft Exchange servers. The suspect, Rami Khaled Ahmed, is accused of deploying the Black Kingdom malware on roughly 1,500 computers in the United States and abroad, demanding ransom payments of $10,000 in Bitcoin. ""According to the indictment, from March 2021 to June 2023, Ahmed and others infected computer networks of several U.S.-based victims, including a medical billing services company in Encino, a ski resort in Oregon, a school district in Pennsylvania, and a health clinic in Wisconsin,""explains a U.S. Department of Justice announcement. ""When the malware was successful, the ransomware then created a ransom note on the victim's system that directed the victim to send $10,000 worth of Bitcoin to a cryptocurrency address controlled by a co-conspirator and to send proof of this payment to a Black Kingdom email address,"" reads another part of the announcement. The U.S. DoJ highlights that Ahmed designed Black Kingdom ransomware to exploit a vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange for initial access to targeted computers. This was first reported in March 2021 by researcherMarcus Hutchins, who discovered web shells deployed by Black Kingdom ransomware operators on Exchange servers vulnerable to ProxyLogon attacks. TheProxyLogonflaw refers to a set of critical vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server that were first disclosed and exploited in early 2021. The flaws are CVE-2021-26855 (Server-Side Request Forgery used for initial access), CVE-2021-26857 (insecure deserialization used for privilege escalation to SYSTEM), and CVE-2021-26858 and CVE-2021-27065 (arbitrary file write used for writing web shells to servers).

CVE-2025-3928,2025-04-30,bleeping computer,"Commvault, a leading provider of data protection solutions, says a nation-state threat actor who breached its Azure environment didn't gain access to customer backup data. Listed on NASDAQ since March 2006, Commvault is included in the S&P MidCap 400 Index and provides cyber resilience services to over 100,000 organizations. As the companyfirst revealed on March 7, 2025, Commvault discovered the incident after being notified by Microsoft on February 20 of suspicious activity within its Azure environment. A follow-up investigation into the breach found that the incident only affected a small number of Commvault customers and had not impacted the company's operations. ""Importantly, there has been no unauthorized access to customer backup data that Commvault stores and protects, and no material impact on our business operations or our ability to deliver products and services,"" Danielle Sheer, the company's Chief Trust Officer,said in a Wednesday update. ""We are working closely with two leading cybersecurity firms and are coordinating with the appropriate authorities, including the FBI, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and others."" In asupport documentcontaining indicators of compromise, Commvault advises customers to apply a Conditional Access policy to all Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and Azure AD single-tenant App registrations to protect their data against similar attack attempts. It also recommended to regularly monitor sign-in activity to detect access attempts originating from IP addresses outside of allowed ranges and to rotate and sync client secrets between Commvault and the Azure portal every 90 days. ""This can help quickly identify potential security breaches or account compromises. If any unauthorized access is detected, immediately report the incident to Commvault Support for further investigation and remediation,"" the company says. The company also noted in the original disclosure that the threat actors exploited a now-patched zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2025-3928) in its Commvault Web Server software that remote authenticated attackers with low privileges can exploit remotely to plant webshells on target servers. CISA has alsoadded the CVE-2025-3928 vulnerabilityto its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog on Monday, requiring federal agencies to secure their Commvault software by May 19, 2025, as mandated by the Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01 issued in November 2021.

CVE-2025-24132,2025-04-29,bleeping computer,"​A set of security vulnerabilities in Apple's AirPlay Protocol and AirPlay Software Development Kit (SDK) exposed unpatched third-party and Apple devices to various attacks, including remote code execution. According to cybersecurity company Oligo Security security researchers who discovered and reported the flaws, they can be exploited in zero-click and one-click RCE attacks, man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, and denial of service (DoS) attacks, as well as to bypass access control list (ACL) and user interaction, to gain access to sensitive information, and read arbitrary local files. In all, Oligo disclosed 23 security vulnerabilities to Apple, which released security updates to address these vulnerabilities (collectively known as ""AirBorne"") on March 31 for iPhones and iPads (iOS 18.4 and iPadOS 18.4), Macs (macOS Ventura 13.7.5,macOS Sonoma 14.7.5, andmacOS Sequoia 15.4), and Apple Vision Pro (visionOS 2.4) devices. The company also patched theAirPlay audio SDK, theAirPlay video SDK, and theCarPlay Communication Plug-in. While the AirBorne vulnerabilities can only be exploited by attackers on the same network via wireless networks or peer-to-peer connections, they allow taking over vulnerable devices and using the access as a launchpad to compromise other AirPlay-enabled devices on the same network. Oligo's security researchers said they were able to demonstrate that attackers can use two of the security flaws (CVE-2025-24252 and CVE-2025-24132) to create wormable zero-click RCE exploits. Additionally, the CVE-2025-24206 user interaction bypass flaw enables a threat actor to bypass ""Accept"" click requirements on AirPlay requests and can be chained with other flaws to launch zero-click attacks. ""This means that an attacker can take over certain AirPlay-enabled devices and do things like deploy malware that spreads to devices on any local network the infected device connects to. This could lead to the delivery of other sophisticated attacks related to espionage, ransomware, supply-chain attacks, and more,""Oligo warned. ""Because AirPlay is a fundamental piece of software for Apple devices (Mac, iPhone, iPad, AppleTV, etc.) as well as third-party devices that leverage the AirPlay SDK, this class of vulnerabilities could have far-reaching impacts."" The cybersecurity company advises organizations to immediately update any corporate Apple devices and AirPlay-enabled devices to the latest software release and ask employees to also update all their personal AirPlay devices. Additional measures users can take to reduce the attack surface include updating all their Apple devices to the latest version, disabling the AirPlay receiver if not used, restricting AirPlay access to trusted devices using firewall rules, and reducing the attack surface by only allowing AirPlay for the current user. Apple says that there areover 2.35 billion active Apple devicesaround the world (including iPhones, iPads, Macs, and others), and Oligo estimates that there are also tens of millions of third-party audio devices like speakers and TVs with AirPlay support, not including car infotainment systems with CarPlay support.

CVE-2025-1976,2025-04-29,bleeping computer,"The U.S. Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is warning of Broadcom Brocade Fabric OS, Commvault web servers, and Qualitia Active! Mail clients vulnerabilities that are actively exploited in attacks. The flaws were added yesterday to CISA's 'Known Exploited Vulnerabilities'(KEV) catalog, with the Broadcom Brocade Fabric OS and Commvault flaws not previously tagged as exploited. Broadcom Brocade Fabric OS is a specialized operating system that runs on the company's Brocade Fibre Channel switches to manage and optimize storage area networks (SAN). Earlier this month, Broadcom disclosed an arbitrary code execution flaw impacting Fabric OS versions 9.1.0 through 9.1.1d6, tracked under CVE-2025-1976. While the flaw requires admin privileges to exploit, Broadcom says it has been actively exploited in attacks. ""This vulnerability can allow the user to execute any existing Fabric OS command or can also be used to modify the Fabric OS itself, including adding their own subroutines,""reads Broadcom's bulletin. ""Even though achieving this exploit first requires valid access to a role with admin privileges, this vulnerability has been actively exploited in the field."" CVE-2025-1976 was addressed with the release of Brocade Fabric OS 9.1.1d7. The latest branch, 9.2.0, is not impacted by this vulnerability. The Commvault flaw, tracked underCVE-2025-3928, is an unspecified security problem that authenticated attackers can exploit remotely to plant webshells on target servers. Commvault web servers are user-facing and API components of a backup system used by enterprises to protect and restore critical data. Despite the requirements for authentication and exposure of the environment to the internet, the flaw is under active exploitation in the wild. CVE-2025-3928 was fixed in versions 11.36.46, 11.32.89, 11.28.141, and 11.20.217 for Windows and Linux platforms. The third flaw CISA added to KEV is CVE-2025-42599, a stack-based buffer overflow problem impacting all versions of Active! up to and including 'BuildInfo: 6.60.05008561' on all OS platforms. Active! mail is a web-based email client widely used by government, financial, and IT service organizations in Japan. The flaw wasflagged as actively exploitedlast week by Japan's CERT, while SMB providers and ISPs in the country also announced service outages caused by related exploitation activity. Qualitia addressed the problem with the release of Active! Mail 6 BuildInfo: 6.60.06008562. CISA has given impacted organizations until May 17, 2025, to apply fixes or available mitigations for CVE-2025-3928 and May 19, 2025, for the other two flaws.

CVE-2025-31324,2025-04-28,bleeping computer,"Over 1,200 internet-exposed SAP NetWeaver instances are vulnerable to an actively exploited maximum severity unauthenticated file upload vulnerability that allows attackers to hijack servers. SAP NetWeaver is an application server and development platform that runs and connects SAP and non-SAP applications across different technologies. Last week, SAP disclosed an unauthenticated file upload vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-31324, in SAP NetWeaver Visual Composer, specifically the Metadata Uploader component. The flaw allows remote attackers to upload arbitrary executable files on exposed instances without authenticating, achieving code execution and full system compromise. Multiple cybersecurity firms, including ReliaQuest, watchTowr, and Onapsis, confirmed the flaw isactively exploited in attacks, with threat actors utilizing it to drop web shells on vulnerable servers. A SAP spokesperson told BleepingComputer that they were aware of these attempts and released a workaround on April 8, 2024, followed by a security update that addressed CVE-2025-31324 on April 25. SAP told BleepingComputer that they are not aware of any cases where these attacks impacted customer data or systems. Researchers have now confirmed that many vulnerable SAP Netweaver servers are exposed on the internet, making them prime targets for attacks. TheShadowserver Foundationfound the427 exposed servers, warning of the massive exposed attack surface and the potentially severe repercussions of exploitation. Most of the vulnerable systems (149) are in the United States, followed by India (50), Australia (37), China (31), Germany (30), the Netherlands (13), Brazil (10), and France (10). However, cyber defense search engineOnyphepaints a more dire picture, telling BleepingComputer that there are 1,284 vulnerable servers exposed online, with 474 already having been compromised with webshells. ""Something like 20 Fortune 500/Global 500 companies are vulnerable, and many of them are compromised,"" Onyphe CTO Patrice Auffret told BleepingComputer. Researchers reported that the threat actors are utilizing webshells with names like, ""cache.jsp"" and ""helper.jsp."" Howver,Nextron Research saysthey are also using random names, making it more difficult to find vulnerable Netweaver instances. While the number of servers is not massive, the risk is still significant, given that large enterprises and multinational corporations commonly use SAP NetWeaver. To address the risk, it is recommended that the latest security update be applied by following the vendor's instructions inthis bulletin. If unable to apply the update, the below mitigations are recommended: RedRays has also released ascanner tool for CVE-2025-31324that can help pinpoint risks in large environments.

CVE-2025-21204,2025-04-25,bleeping computer,"A recent Windows security update that creates an ‘inetpub’ folder has introduced a new weakness allowing attackers to prevent the installation of future updates. After people installed this month'sMicrosoft Patch Tuesdaysecurity updates, Windows userssuddenly found an ""inetpub"" folderowned by the SYSTEM account created in the root of the system drive, normally the C: drive. It was strange to see this folder created as it is normally used to hold files associated with Microsoft's Internet Information Service web server, which was not installed on these devices. In an update to asecurity advisory, Microsoft later confirmed that the C:\inetpub folder was part of a fix for a Windows Process Activation elevation of privilege vulnerability tracked as CVE-2025-21204, with the companywarning not to delete the folder. ""After installing the updates listed in the Security Updates table for your operating system, a new %systemdrive%\inetpub folder will be created on your device,""confirmed Microsoft. ""This folder should not be deleted regardless of whether Internet Information Services (IIS) is active on the target device. This behavior is part of changes that increase protection and does not require any action from IT admins and end users."" However, cybersecurity expert Kevin Beaumont has demonstrated that this folder can be abused to prevent further Windows updates from being installed if it is created a certain way. ""I've discovered this fix introduces a denial of service vulnerability in the Windows servicing stack that allows non-admin users to stop all future Windows security updates,"" Kevin Beaumont. In a new report,Beaumont saysthat Windows users, even those without administrative privileges, can create a junction between C:\inetpub and a Windows file, like C:\windows\system32\notepad.exe using the following command. A Windows junction is a special type of folder that redirects access to another folder on the same or another drive, making it appear as though the content exists in both locations. When asked why this junction is preventing the update from being installed, Beaumont says he believes it's because the update expects a folder rather than a file. ""It works with basically any file, I think it's because the servicing stack expects c:\inetpub to be a directory - but mklink allows you to make a junction to a file,"" Beaumont told BleepingComputer. According toMicrosoft's documentation, junctions are meant to be links between folders rather than between files. However, as you can see from the image earlier in the article, it is still possible to create one as shown in the image below. With this junction created, if you attempt to install the April security update, it will not install correctly, giving a0x800F081F error code. This code is related to the error ""CBS_E_SOURCE_MISSING,"" which means a package or file was not found. Beaumont says he reported the bug to Microsoft, who has assigned it a ""Medium"" severity classification and closed his case, stating they will consider fixing it in the future. ""After careful investigation, this case is currently rated as a Moderate severity issue,""Microsoft emailed Beaumont. ""It does not meet MSRCs current bar for immediate servicing as the update fails to apply only if the 'inetpub' folder is a junction to a file and succeeds upon deleting the inetpub symlink and retrying."" BleepingComputer also contacted Microsoft about this bug on Wednesday but has not received a response yet. Based on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.

CVE-2025-32433,2025-04-19,bleeping computer,"Public exploits are now available for a critical Erlang/OTP SSH vulnerability tracked as CVE-2025-32433, allowing unauthenticated attackers to remotely execute code on impacted devices. Researchers at the Ruhr University Bochum in Germany disclosed the flaw on Wednesday, warning that all devices running the daemon were vulnerable. ""The issue is caused by a flaw in the SSH protocol message handling which allows an attacker to send connection protocol messages prior to authentication,"" readsa disclosureon the OpenWall vulnerability mailing list. The flaw was fixed in versions 25.3.2.10 and 26.2.4, but as the paltform is commonly used in telecom infrastructure, databases, and high-availability systems, it may not be easy to update devices immediately. However, the situation has become more urgent, as multiple cybersecurity researchers have privately created exploits that achieve remote code execution on vulnerable devices. This includesPeter Girnusof the Zero Day Initiative and researchers from Horizon3, who said the flaw wassurprisingly easy to exploit. Soon after, PoC exploits werepublished on GitHubby ProDefense, and another was published anonymously on Pastebin, with both quickly shared on social media. Girnus confirmed to BleepingComputer that ProDefense's PoC is valid but was not able to successfully exploit Erlang/OTP SSH using the one posted to Pastebin. Now that public exploits are available, threat actors will soon begin scanning for vulnerable systems and exploiting them. ""SSH is the most commonly used remote access management protocol so I expect this combination to be widespread in critical infrastructure,"" Girnus told BleepingComputer. ""It's a bit concerning especially considering how frequently telcos are targeted by nation state APTs such as Volt and Salt Typhoon for example."" Girnus refers to the Chinese state-sponsored hacking groups responsible forhacking edge networking equipmentandbreaching telecommunications providersin the US and worldwide. According toShodan queryshared by Girnus, there are over 600,000 IP addresses running Erlang/OTP. However, the researcher says the majority of these devices are running CouchDB, which is not impacted by the vulnerability. An Apache CouchDB representative also confirmed to BleepingComputer that CouchDB does not use the SSH server or client features from Erlang/OTP, so is not vulnerable. Now that public exploits are available, it is strongly advised that all devices running Erlang OTP SSH be upgraded immediately before threat actors compromise them.

CVE-2021-20035,2025-04-18,bleeping computer,"A remote code execution vulnerability affecting SonicWall Secure Mobile Access (SMA) appliances has been under active exploitation since at least January 2025, according to cybersecurity company Arctic Wolf. This security flaw (CVE-2021-20035) impacts SMA 200, SMA 210, SMA 400, SMA 410, and SMA 500v devices and was patched almost four years ago, in September 2021, when SonicWall said it could only be exploited to take down vulnerable appliances in denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. However, the company updated the four-year-old security advisory on Monday toflag the security bug as exploited in attacks, expand the impact to include remote code execution, and upgrade the CVSS severity score from medium to high severity. ""This vulnerability is believed to be actively exploited in the wild. As a precautionary measure, SonicWall PSIRT has updated the summary and revised the CVSS score to 7.2,"" SonicWall said. Successful exploitation can allow remote threat actors with low privileges to exploit an ""improper neutralization of special elements in the SMA100 management interface"" to inject arbitrary commands as a 'nobody' user and execute arbitrary code in low-complexity attacks. CISA has also added the vulnerability to itsKnown Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog, confirmingit's now being abused in the wildand ordering Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to secure their networks against ongoing attacks until May 7th. Days after SonicWall tagged the security bug as exploited in the wild without sharing when the attacks started, cybersecurity company Arctic Wolf reported that threat actors used CVE-2021-20035 exploits in attacks as early as January 2025. In this campaign, the attackers have also used a local super admin account with a ""password"" default password to target SMA 100 appliances with the management interface exposed online. ""Arctic Wolf has identified an ongoing VPN credential access campaign targeting SMA 100 series appliances, with a starting timeframe as early as January 2025, extending into April 2025,""the cybersecurity firm said. ""One noteworthy aspect of the campaign was the use of a local super admin account (admin@LocalDomain) on these appliances, which has an insecure default password of password."" To block CVE-2021-20035 attacks targeting their SonicWall appliances, Arctic Wolf advised network defenders to limit VPN access to the minimum necessary accounts, deactivate unneeded accounts, enable multi-factor authentication for all accounts, and reset passwords for all local accounts on SonicWall SMA firewalls. In February, SonicWall also urged customers in January to patch acritical vulnerability affecting SMA1000 secure access gatewaysfollowing reports that it had already been exploited in zero-day attacks and, one month later, warned of anactively exploited authentication bypass flawin Gen 6 and Gen 7 firewalls that can let hackershijack VPN sessions.

CVE-2021-40449,2025-04-18,bleeping computer,"Chinese-speaking IronHusky hackers are targeting Russian and Mongolian government organizations using upgraded MysterySnail remote access trojan (RAT) malware. Security researchers at Kaspersky's Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT) spotted the updated implant while investigating recent attacks where the attackers deployed the RAT malware using a malicious MMC script camouflaged as a Word document, which downloaded second-stage payloads and gained persistence on compromised systems. One of the malicious payloads is an unknown intermediary backdoor that helps transfer files between the command and control servers and hacked devices, run command shells, create new processes, delete files, and more. ""In our telemetry, these files turned out to leave footprints of the MysterySnail RAT malware, an implant we described back in 2021. In observed infection cases, MysterySnail RAT was configured to persist on compromised machines as a service,""Kaspersky said. ""Notably, a short time after we blocked the recent intrusions related to MysterySnail RAT, we observed the attackers to continue conducting their attacks, by deploying a repurposed and more lightweight version of MysterySnail RAT. This version consists of a single component, and that's why we dubbed it MysteryMonoSnail."" As they found, the upgraded RAT malware supports dozens of commands, allowing attackers to manage services on the compromised device, execute shell commands, spawn and kill processes, and manage files, among other things. This latest backdoor version is similar to the original MysterySnail RAT, which Kasperskyfirst detected in late August 2021in widespread espionage attacks against IT companies, military/defense contractors, and diplomatic entities in Russia and Mongolia. At the time, the IronHusky hacking group was observed deploying the malware on systems compromised using zero-day exploits targeting a Windows Win32k kernel driver vulnerability (CVE-2021-40449). The Chinese APT wasfirst spotted by Kaspersky in 2017while investigating a campaign targeting Russian and Mongolian government entities with the end goal of collecting intelligence on Russian-Mongolian military negotiations.

CVE-2025-4919,2025-05-19,bleeping computer,"Mozilla released emergency security updates to address two Firefox zero-day vulnerabilities demonstrated in the recent Pwn2Own Berlin 2025 hacking competition. The fixes, which include the Firefox on Desktop and Android and two Extended Support Releases (ESR), came mere hours after the conclusion of Pwn2Own, on Saturday, where the second vulnerability was demonstrated. The first flaw, tracked underCVE-2025-4918, is an out-of-bounds read/write issue in the JavaScript engine when resolving Promise objects. The flaw was demonstrated duringDay 2 of the competitionby Palo Alto Networks security researchers Edouard Bochin and Tao Yan, who earned $50,000 for their discovery. The second flaw,CVE-2025-4919, allows attackers to perform out-of-bounds reads/writes on a JavaScript object by confusing array index sizes. It was discovered by security researcher Manfred Paul, who gained unauthorized access within the program's renderer, winning $50,000 in the process. Although the flaws constitute significant risks for Firefox, with Mozilla rating them ""critical"" in its bulletins, the software vendor underlined that neither researchers could perform a sandbox escape, citing targeted strengthening on that front. ""Unlike prior years, neither participating group was able to escape our sandbox this year,""explained Firefox in the announcement. ""We have verbal confirmation that this is attributed to the recent architectural improvements to our Firefox sandbox which have neutered a wide range of such attacks."" Although there are no indications that the two flaws have been exploited outside of Pwn2Own, their public demonstration could fuel real attacks soon.

CVE-2025-32433,2025-04-17,bleeping computer,"A critical vulnerability in the Erlang/OTP SSH, tracked as CVE-2025-32433, has been disclosed that allows for unauthenticated remote code execution on vulnerable devices. The flaw was discovered by Fabian Bäumer, Marcus Brinkmann, Marcel Maehren, and Jörg Schwenk of the Ruhr University Bochum in Germany and given a maximum severity score of 10.0. All devices running the Erlang/OTP SSH daemon are impacted by the vulnerability and are advised to upgrade to versions 25.3.2.10 and 26.2.4 to fix the flaw. Erlang is a programming language known for its fault-tolerance and concurrency, making it commonly used in telecom infrastructure and high -availability systems. Erlang/OTP is a set of libraries, design principles, and tools built on top of Erlang that provides components like the SSH application for remote access. The CVE-2025-32433 vulnerability is caused by the improper handling of certain pre-authentication protocol messages within the SSH daemon provided by Erlang/OTP's SSH application. ""The issue is caused by a flaw in the SSH protocol message handling which allows an attacker to send connection protocol messages prior to authentication,"" readsa disclosureon the OpenWall vulnerability mailing list. Any commands executed through the vulnerability will be run with the same privileges as the SSH daemon. In many cases, the daemon runs as root, which would allow attackers to fully compromise the system. Horizon3's Attack Team, known for their exploit research, warned on X that they had reproduced the flaw and found it ""surprisingly easy,"" demonstrating a PoC that writes a file as root on affected systems. ""Just finished reproducing CVE-2025-32433 and putting together a quick PoC exploit — surprisingly easy. Wouldn't be shocked if public PoCs start dropping soon. If you're tracking this, now's the time to take action,""Horizon3 posted to X. Organizations are strongly advised to upgrade to the fixed versions immediately before a PoC becomes public and the flaw is mass-exploited. For systems, such as industrial or mission-critical devices that can't be easily updated, it is advised that access to SSH be restricted to trusted IPs, or the SSH daemon should be turned off if not needed.

CVE-2025-24054,2025-04-17,bleeping computer,"A Windows vulnerability that exposes NTLM hashes using .library-ms files is now actively exploited by hackers in phishing campaigns targeting government entities and private companies. The flaw tracked asCVE-2025-24054was fixed in Microsoft'sMarch 2025 Patch Tuesday. Initially, it was not marked as actively exploited and was assessed as 'less likely' to be. However, Check Point researchers report having observed active exploitation activity for CVE-2025-24054 only a few days after patches became available, culminating between March 20 and 25, 2025. Although one IP address behind these attacks was previously linked to the Russia state-sponsored threat group APT28 ('Fancy Bear'), it is not enough evidence for confident attribution. NTLM (New Technology LAN Manager) is a Microsoft authentication protocol that uses challenge-response negotiation involving hashes instead of transmitting plaintext passwords to authenticate users. While NTLM avoids transmitting plaintext passwords, it is no longer considered secure due to vulnerabilities likereplay attacksandbrute-force cracking of captured hashes. Due to this, Microsoft hasbegun phasing out NTLM authenticationin favor of Kerberos or Negotiate. In attacks seen by Check Point, phishing emails were sent to entities in Poland and Romania that included a Dropbox link to a ZIP archive, containing a .library-ms file. A library-ms file is a legitimate file type that, when opened, shows aWindows library, or virtual container, that contains files and folders from different configured sources. In this phishing attack, the library-ms file was created to contain a path to a remote SMB server under the attacker's control. When extracting a ZIP file that contains a .library-ms file, Windows Explorer will interact with it automatically, triggering the CVE-2025-24054 flaw and causing Windows to make an SMB connection to the URL specified in the file. When Windows connects to the remote SMB server, it will attempt to authenticate via NTLM, allowing the attacker to capture the user's NTLM hashes. In a later campaign, Check Point discovered phishing emails that contained .library-ms attachments, without an archive. Simply downloading the .library-ms file was enough to trigger NTLM authentication to the remote server, demonstrating that archives were not required to exploit the flaw. ""On March 25, 2025, Check Point Research discovered a campaign targeting companies around the world, distributing these files without being zipped,""explains Check Point. ""According to Microsoft, this exploit is triggered with minimal user interaction with a malicious file, such as selecting (single-clicking), inspecting (right-clicking), or performing any action other than opening or executing the file."" The malicious archive also contains three more files, namely 'xd.url,' 'xd.website,' and 'xd.link,' which leverage older NTLM hash leak flaws and are most likely included for redundancy in case the 'library-ms' method fails. Check Point says the attacker-controlled SMB servers in this campaign were using the 159.196.128[.]120 and 194.127.179[.]157 IP addresses. Capturing NTLM hashes could open the way to authentication bypass and privilege escalation, so even though CVE-2025-24054 is only evaluated as a ""medium"" severity issue, its potential consequences are grave. Given the low interaction required to exploit, organizations should treat this as a high-risk issue. It is advised that all organizations should install the March 2025 updates and turn off NTLM authentication if it is not required. Based on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.

CVE-2021-20035,2025-04-17,bleeping computer,"On Wednesday, CISA warned federal agencies to secure their SonicWall Secure Mobile Access (SMA) 100 series appliances against attacks exploiting a high-severity remote code execution vulnerability. Tracked asCVE-2021-20035, this security flaw impacts SMA 200, SMA 210, SMA 400, SMA 410, and SMA 500v (ESX, KVM, AWS, Azure) devices. Successful exploitation can allow remote threat actors with low privileges to execute arbitrary code in low-complexity attacks. ""Improper neutralization of special elements in the SMA100 management interface allows a remote authenticated attacker to inject arbitrary commands as a 'nobody' user, which could potentially lead to code execution,"" SonicWallexplainsin an advisory updated this week. SonicWall patched this vulnerability almost four years ago, in September 2021, when the company said it could only be exploited to take down vulnerable appliances in denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. However, on Monday, it updated the CVE-2021-20035 security advisory to flag it as exploited in attacks, upgrade the CVSS severity score from medium to high, and expand the impact to include code execution. ""This vulnerability is believed to be actively exploited in the wild. As a precautionary measure, SonicWall PSIRT has updated the summary and revised the CVSS score to 7.2,"" SonicWall said. Yesterday, CISA confirmed thevulnerability is now being abused in the wildby adding it to theKnown Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog, which lists security flaws flagged by the cybersecurity agency as actively exploited in attacks. As mandated by the Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01 issued in November 2021, Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies now have three weeks, until May 7th, to secure their networks against ongoing attacks. While BOD 22-01 only applies to U.S. federal agencies, all network defenders should prioritize patching this security vulnerability as soon as possible to block potential breach attempts. ""These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise,""CISA warned. In February, SonicWall also warned of anactively exploited authentication bypass flawin Gen 6 and Gen 7 firewalls that could let hackershijack VPN sessions.

CVE-2025-3102,2025-04-10,bleeping computer,"Hackers started exploiting a high-severity flaw that allows bypassing authentication in the OttoKit (formerly SureTriggers) plugin for WordPress just hours after public disclosure. Users are strongly recommended to upgrade to the latest version of OttoKit/SureTriggers, currently 1.0.79, released at the beginning of the month. TheOttoKit WordPress pluginallows users to connect plugins and external tools like WooCommerce, Mailchimp, and Google Sheets, automate tasks like sending emails and adding users, or updating CRMs without code. Statisticsshowthat the product is active on 100,000 websites. Yesterday,Wordfence disclosedan authentication bypass vulnerability in OttoKit, identified as CVE-2025-3102. The flaw impacts all versions of SureTriggers/OttoKit up to 1.0.78. The flaw stems from a missing empty value check in theauthenticate_user()function, which handles REST API authentication. Exploitation to be possible if the plugin is not configured with an API key, which causes the storedsecret_keyto remain empty. An attacker could exploit this by sending an emptyst_authorizationheader to pass the check and grant unauthorized access to protected API endpoints. Essentially, CVE-2025-3102 allows attackers to create new administrator accounts without authentication, posing a high risk of full site takeover. Wordfence received a report about the flaw from security researcher 'mikemyers', who earned a bounty of $1,024 for the discovery in mid-March. The plugin vendor was contacted on April 3 with the full exploitation details, and they released a fix via version 1.0.79 on the same day. However, hackers quickly jumped at the opportunity to exploit the issue, taking advantage of administrators' delay in updating the plugin to address the security problem. Researchers at WordPress security platform Patchstack are warning that the first exploitation attempts in the wild were logged only a few hours after the disclosure of the flaw. “Attackers were quick to exploit this vulnerability, with the first recorded attempt occurring just four hours after it was added as a vPatch to our database,”reports Patchstack. “This swift exploitation highlights the critical need to apply patches or mitigations immediately upon the public disclosure of such vulnerabilities,” the researchers say. The threat actors attempt to create new administrator accounts using randomized username/password and email address combination, a sign of task automation. If you’re using OttoKit/SureTriggers, upgrade to version 1.0.79 as soon as possible and check logs for unexpected admin accounts or other user roles, installation of plugins/themes, database access events, and modification of security settings.

CVE-2025-30401,2025-04-08,bleeping computer,"Meta warned Windows users to update the WhatsApp messaging app to the latest version to patch a vulnerability that can let attackers execute malicious code on their devices. Described as a spoofing issue and tracked asCVE-2025-30401, this security flaw can be exploited by attackers by sending maliciously crafted files with altered file types to potential targets. Metasaysthe vulnerability impacted all WhatsApp versions and has been fixed with the release of WhatsApp 2.2450.6. ""A spoofing issue in WhatsApp for Windows prior to version 2.2450.6 displayed attachments according to their MIME type but selected the file opening handler based on the attachment's filename extension,"" WhatsAppexplained in a Tuesday advisory. ""A maliciously crafted mismatch could have caused the recipient to inadvertently execute arbitrary code rather than view the attachment when manually opening the attachment inside WhatsApp."" Meta says an external researcher found and reported the flaw via a Meta Bug Bounty submission. The company has yet to share if CVE-2025-30401 was exploited in the wild. In July 2024,WhatsApp addressed a slightly similar issuethat allowed Python and PHP attachments to be executed without warning when recipients opened them on Windows devices with Python installed. More recently, following reports from security researchers at the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab, WhatsApp alsopatched a zero-click, zero-day security vulnerabilitythat was exploited to install Paragon's Graphite spyware. The company said the attack vector was addressed late last year ""without the need for a client-side fix"" and decided against assigning a CVE-ID after ""reviewing the CVE guidelines published by MITRE, and [its] own internal policies."" On January 31, after mitigating the security issue server-side, WhatsAppalerted roughly 90 Android usersfrom over two dozen countries, includingItalian journalistsand activists who were targeted in Paragon spyware attacks using the zero-click exploit. Last December, a U.S. federal judge also ruled that Israeli spyware maker NSO Group used WhatsApp zero-days to deploy Pegasus spyware on at least 1,400 devices, thus violating U.S. hacking laws. Court documentsrevealed that NSO allegedly deployed Pegasus spyware in zero-click attacks that exploited WhatsApp vulnerabilities using multiple zero-day exploits. The documents also said that the spyware maker's developers reverse-engineered WhatsApp's code to create tools that sent malicious messages that installed spyware, violating federal and state laws.

CVE-2025-24071,2025-04-07,bleeping computer,"EncryptHub, a notorious threat actor linked to breaches at 618 organizations, is believed to have reported two Windows zero-day vulnerabilities to Microsoft, revealing a conflicted figure straddling the line between cybercrime and security research. The reported vulnerabilities areCVE-2025-24061(Mark of the Web bypass) andCVE-2025-24071(File Explorer spoofing), which Microsoft addressed during theMarch 2025 Patch Tuesdayupdates, acknowledging the reporter as 'SkorikARI with SkorikARI .' Anew report by Outpost24researchers has now linked the EncryptHub threat actor with SkorikARI after the threat actor allegedly infected himself and exposed their credentials. This exposure allowed the researchers to link the threat actor to various online accounts and expose the profile of a person who vacillates between being a cybersecurity researcher and a cybercriminal. One of the exposed accounts is SkorikARI, which the hacker used to disclose the two mentioned zero-day vulnerabilities to Microsoft, contributing to Windows security. Hector Garcia, Security Analyst at Outpost24, told BleepingComputer that the link of SkorikARI to EncryptHub is based on multiple pieces of evidence, making up for a high-confidence assessment. ""The hardest evidence was from the fact that the password files EncrypHub exfiltrated from his own system had accounts linked to both EncryptHub, like credentials to EncryptRAT, which was still in development, or his account on xss.is, and to SkorikARI, like accesses to freelance sites or his own Gmail account,"" explained Garcia. ""There was also a login to hxxps:// github[.]com/SkorikJR, which was mentioned in July's Fortinet Article about Fickle Stealer, bringing it all together."" ""Another huge confirmation of the link between the two were the conversations with ChatGPT, where activity related both to EncryptHub and to SkorikARI can be observed."" EncryptHub's foray into zero-days is not new, with the threat actor or one of the members attempting to sell zero-days to other cybercriminals on hacking forums. Outpost24 delved into EncryptHub's journey, stating that the hacker repeatedly shifts between freelance development work and cybercrime activity. Despite his apparent IT expertise, the hacker reportedly fell victim to bad opsec practices that allowed his personal information to be exposed.

CVE-2025-31334,2025-04-05,bleeping computer,"A vulnerability in the WinRAR file archiver solution could be exploited to bypass the Mark of the Web (MotW) security warning and execute arbitrary code on a Windows machine. The security issue is tracked as CVE-2025-31334 and affects all WinRAR versions except the most recent release, which is currently 7.11. Mark of the Web is a security function in Windows in the form of a metadata value (an alternate data stream named ‘zone-identifier’) to tag as potentially unsafe files downloaded from the internet. When opening an executable with the MotW tag, Windows warns the user that it was downloaded from the internet and could be harmful and offers the option to continue execution or terminate it.  The CVE-2025-31334 vulnerability can help a threat actor bypass the MotW security warning when opening a symbolic link (symlink) pointing to an executable file in any WinRAR version before 7.11. An attacker could execute arbitrary code by using a specially crafted symbolic link. It should be noted that a symlink can be created on Windows only with administrator permissions. The security issue received amedium severity score of 6.8 and has been fixed in the latest version of WinRAR, as noted in the applications change log: “If symlink pointing at an executable was started from WinRAR shell, the executable Mark of the Web data was ignored” -WinRAR The vulnerability was reported by Shimamine Taihei of Mitsui Bussan Secure Directions through the Information Technology Promotion Agency (IPA) in Japan. Japan’s Computer Security Incident Response Teamcoordinatedthe responsible disclosure with WinRAR’s developer. Starting version 7.10, WinRAR provides the possibility to remove from the MotW alternate data stream information (e.g. location, IP address) that could be considered a privacy risk. Threat actors, including state-sponsored ones, have exploited MotW bypasses in the past to deliver various malware without triggering the security warning. Recently, Russian hackers leveraged such a vulnerability in the 7-Zip archiver, which did not propagate the MotW whendouble archiving(archiving a file within another one) to run the Smokeloader malware dropper.

The problem stems from the deserialization of untrusted data that could allow attackers with specially crafted Parquet files to gain control of target systems, exfiltrate or modify data, disrupt services, or introduce dangerous payloads such as ransomware. The vulnerability is tracked underCVE-2025-30065and has a CVSS v4 score of 10.0. The flaw was fixed with the release of Apache version 1.15.1. It should be noted that to exploit this flaw, threat actors must convince someone to import a specially crafted Parquet file. Apache Parquet is an open-source, columnar storage format designed for efficient data processing. Unlike row-based formats (like CSV), Parquet stores data by columns, which makes it faster and more space-efficient for analytical workloads. It is widely adopted across the data engineering and analytics ecosystem, including big data platforms like Hadoop, AWS, Amazon, Google, and Azure cloud services, data lakes, and ETL tools. Some large companies that use Parquet include Netflix, Uber, Airbnb, and LinkedIn. The security problem in Parquet was disclosed on April 1, 2025, following a responsible disclosure by its finder, Amazon researcher Keyi Li. ""Schema parsing in the parquet-avro module of Apache Parquet 1.15.0 and previous versions allows bad actors to execute arbitrary code,"" warned the shortbulletin published on Openwall. ""Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.15.1, which fixes the issue."" A separate bulletin by Endor Labs highlights the risk of CVE-2025-30065 exploitation more clearly, warning that the flaw can impact any data pipelines and analytics systems that import Parquet files, with the risk being significant for files sourced from external points. Endor Labs believes the problem was introduced in Parquet version 1.8.0, though older releases might also be impacted. The firm suggests coordinated checks with developers and vendors to determine what Praquet versions are used in production software stacks. ""If an attacker tricks a vulnerable system into reading a specially crafted Parquet file, they could gain remote code execution (RCE) on that system,""warns Endor Labs. However, the security firm avoids over-inflating the risk by including the note, ""Despite the frightening potential, it's important to note that the vulnerability can only be exploited if a malicious Parquet file is imported."" That being said, if upgrading to Apache Parquet 1.15.1 immediately is impossible, it is suggested to avoid untrusted Parquet files or carefully validate their safety before processing them. Also, monitoring and logging on systems that handle Parquet processing should be increased. Although no active exploitation has been discovered yet, the risk is high due to the flaw's severity and the widespread use of Parquet files in big data applications. Administrators of impacted systems are recommended to upgrade to Parquet version 1.15.1, which addresses CVE-2025-30065, as soon as possible. Based on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.

CVE-2025-0282,2025-04-03,bleeping computer,"Ivanti has released security updates to patch a critical Connect Secure remote code execution vulnerability exploited by a China-linked espionage actor to deploy malware since at least mid-March 2025. Tracked asCVE-2025-22457, this critical security flaw is due to a stack-based buffer overflow weakness. It impacts Pulse Connect Secure 9.1x (which reached end-of-support in December), Ivanti Connect Secure 22.7R2.5 and earlier, Policy Secure, and Neurons for ZTA gateways. According toIvanti's advisory, remote threat actors can exploit it in high-complexity attacks that don't require authentication or user interaction. The company patched the vulnerability on February 11, 2025, with the release of Ivanti Connect Secure 22.7R2.6 after initially tagging it as a product bug. ""The vulnerability is a buffer overflow with characters limited to periods and numbers, it was evaluated and determined not to be exploitable as remote code execution and didn't meet the requirements of denial of service,"" Ivantisaid on Thursday. ""However, Ivanti and our security partners have now learned the vulnerability is exploitable through sophisticated means and have identified evidence of active exploitation in the wild.

While security patches for ZTA and Ivanti Policy Secure gateways are still in development and will be released on April 19 and April 21, respectively, Ivanti said that it's ""not aware of any exploitation"" targeting these gateways, which also have what ""meaningfully reduced risk from this vulnerability."" Ivanti also advised admins to monitor their external Integrity Checker Tool (ICT) and look for web server crashes.

CVE-2025-0678,2025-03-31,bleeping computer,"Microsoft used its AI-powered Security Copilot to discover 20 previously unknown vulnerabilities in the GRUB2, U-Boot, and Barebox open-source bootloaders. GRUB2 (GRand Unified Bootloader) is the default boot loader for most Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, while U-Boot and Barebox are commonly used in embedded and IoT devices. Microsoft discovered eleven vulnerabilities in GRUB2, including integer and buffer overflows in filesystem parsers, command flaws, and a side-channel in cryptographic comparison. Additionally, 9 buffer overflows in parsing SquashFS, EXT4, CramFS, JFFS2, and symlinks were discovered in U-Boot and Barebox, which require physical access to exploit. The newly discovered flaws impact devices relying on UEFI Secure Boot, and if the right conditions are met, attackers can bypass security protections to execute arbitrary code on the device. While exploiting these flaws would likely need local access to devices, previous bootkit attacks likeBlackLotusachieved this through malware infections. ""While threat actors would likely require physical device access to exploit the U-boot or Barebox vulnerabilities, in the case of GRUB2, the vulnerabilities could further be exploited to bypass Secure Boot and install stealthy bootkits or potentially bypass other security mechanisms, such as BitLocker,""explains Microsoft. ""The implications of installing such bootkits are significant, as this can grant threat actors complete control over the device, allowing them to control the boot process and operating system, compromise additional devices on the network, and pursue other malicious activities."" ""Furthermore, it could result in persistent malware that remains intact even after an operating system reinstallation or a hard drive replacement."" Below is a summary of the flaws Microsoft uncovered in GRUB2: All of the above flaws are rated medium severity, except for CVE-2025-0678, which is rated ""high"" (CVSS v3.1 score: 7.8). Microsoft says Security Copilot dramatically accelerated the vulnerability discovery process in a large and complex codebase, such as GRUB2, saving approximately 1 week of time that would be required for manual analysis. Not only did the AI tool identify the previously undiscovered flaws, but it also provided targeted mitigation recommendations that could provide pointers and accelerate the issuing of security patches, especially in open-source projects supported by volunteer contributors and small core teams. Using the findings in the analysis, Microsoft says Security Copilot found similar bugs in projects utilizing shared code with GRUB2, such as U-boot and Barebox. GRUB2, U-boot, and Barebox releasedsecurity updatesfor the vulnerabilities in February 2025, so updating to the latest versions should mitigate the flaws.

The Walmart division operates over 600 warehouse clubs with millions of members across the United States and Puerto Rico and almost 200 additional locations in Mexico and China. Sam's Club has over 2.3 million employees and reported a total revenue of $84.3 billion for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2023. ""We are aware of reports regarding a potential security incident and are actively investigating the matter,"" a Sam's Club spokesperson told BleepingComputer. ""Protecting the privacy and security of our members' information is a top priority at Sam's Club. We take these concerns seriously and will communicate further as appropriate."" While the company didn't provide additional details regarding this ongoing investigation, the Clop ransomware gang added a new Sam's Club entry to its dark web leak site on Friday. The cybercrime group has yet to publish any proof of the breach, and so far, the threat actors only said on their leak site that the Arkansas wholesaler ""doesn't care about its customers, it ignored their security."" ​Clop's claims of a Sam's Club breach come after the ransomware gang also started extorting dozens of victims in January, breached in a massive wave of data theft attacks targeting azero-day vulnerability (CVE-2024-50623)in Cleo secure file transfer software patched in October. While it's currently unknown how many companies were breached in the Cleo zero-day attacks, Cleo claims its products are used by over 4,000 organizations worldwide. Arizona-based Western Alliance Bank, one of many companies added to Clop's leak site in January,notified nearly 22,000 customerslast week that their personal information was stolen in October after exploiting a vulnerability in third-party secure file transfer software. The Clop ransomware gang was previously linked to otherdata theft campaignstargeting zero-day flaws inAccellion FTA,MOVEit Transfer, andGoAnywhere MFT. This isn't the first security incident that impacted Sam's Club customers in recent years. In October 2020, Sam's Clubnotified some customersthat their accounts were compromised in credential stuffing attacks and automatically reset their SamsClub.com passwords. ""This was not a breach of our systems, but rather a case of these parties obtaining user names and passwords from phishing campaigns, planting malware or breaches at other companies,"" a Sam's Club spokesperson told BleepingComputer at the time.

CVE-2025-2783,2025-03-27,bleeping computer,"Mozilla has released Firefox 136.0.4 to patch a critical security vulnerability that can let attackers escape the web browser's sandbox on Windows systems. Tracked asCVE-2025-2857, this flaw is described as an ""incorrect handle could lead to sandbox escapes"" and was reported by Mozilla developer Andrew McCreight. The vulnerability impacts the latest Firefox standard and extended support releases (ESR) designed for organizations that require extended support for mass deployments. Mozilla fixed the security flaw in Firefox 136.0.4 and Firefox ESR versions 115.21.1 and 128.8.1. While Mozilla didn't share technical details regarding CVE-2025-2857, it said thevulnerability is similar to a Chrome zero-dayexploited in attacks and patched by Google earlier this week. ""Following the sanbdox escape in CVE-2025-2783, various Firefox developers identified a similar pattern in our IPC code. Attackers were able to confuse the parent process into leaking handles into unpriviled [sic] child processes leading to a sandbox escape,"" Mozilla said in a Thursday advisory. ""The original vulnerability was being exploited in the wild. This only affects Firefox on Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected."" Kaspersky's Boris Larin and Igor Kuznetsov, who discovered and reported CVE-2025-2783 to Google, said on Tuesday that the zero-day was exploited in the wild to bypass Chrome sandbox protections and infect targets with sophisticated malware. They spotted CVE-2025-2783 exploits deployed in a cyber-espionage campaign dubbed Operation ForumTroll, targeting Russian government organizations and journalists at unnamed Russian media outlets.

CVE-2025-0731,2025-03-27,bleeping computer,"Dozens of vulnerabilities in products from three leading makers of solar inverters, Sungrow, Growatt, and SMA, could be exploited to control devices or execute code remotely on the vendor’s cloud platform. The potential impact of the security problems has been assessed as severe because they could be used in attacks that could at least influence grid stability, and affect user privacy. In a grimmer scenario, the vulnerabilities could be exploited to disrupt or damage power grids by creating an imbalance between power generation and demand. Security researchers at Vedere Labs, the cybersecurity research arm of network security company Forescout, found 46 vulnerabilities in solar inverters from Sungrow, Growatt, and SMA - three of the top six manufacturers in the world. The potential impact of some of the vulnerabilities is significant as they could lead to unauthorized access to resources in cloud platforms, remote code execution (RCE), device takeover, information disclosure, physical damage, and denial of service. Of the 46 issues discovered, only one, CVE-2025-0731, impacts SMA products. An attacker could use it to achieve remote code execution by uploading .ASPX files that would be executed by the web server at sunnyportal.com - the company's platform for monitoring photovoltaic (PV) systems. In a report today, Forescout describes how an attacker could use the newly disclosed vulnerabilities to hijack Growatt and Sungrow inverters. The researchers say that taking control of Growatt inverters is easier ""because it can be achieved via the cloud backend only."" However, they note that although control over the device is not complete, a threat actor has access to the inverter's configuration parameters and can modify them. An attacker could enumerate without authentication usernames from an exposed Growatt API and then take over accounts by exploiting two IDOR (insecure direct object references) vulnerabilities, or steal credentials via JavaScript injection by leveraging two stored XSS issues. With this type of access, a threat actor ""can perform operations on the connected inverter devices, such as switching it on or off."" The researchers say that taking control of Sungrow inverters is ""slightly more complex"" because it involves multiple vulnerable components of the vendor's architecture: The two attack scenarios above consider only one residential and one commercial inverter but an attacker could follow the same steps to obtain serial numbers of accounts for a fleet of managed devices. With control over an entire fleet of inverters, an attack on a power grid could be amplified to dangerous levels. ""Each inverter can modulate its power generation within the range permitted by current PV panel production levels. The combined effect of the hijacked inverters produces a large effect on power generation in the grid"" -Forescout Vedere Labs An adversary could obtain a significantly more damaging effect by controlling the hijacked devices as a botnet in a coordinated attack to reduce PV inverters' power generation during peak production hours, thus influencing the load on the grid. The researchers explain that this is achieved by ""modulating the power generation of inverters inversely to the attempts of the primary control."" ""When the primary control decreases the load at its maximum capacity, the attack will reduce all its load immediately, forcing the primary control to raise the load in the system followed by an immediate increase of the load by the attack"" - Forescout Vedere Labs Apart from disrupting a power grid, the disclosed vulnerabilities can also be exploited in scenarios that impact user privacy, hijacking smart devices in the house that may be controlled through the vendor's cloud platform, or even ransomware attacks by holding the devices hostage until a ransom is paid. The researchers say thatSungrowandSMApatched all reported vulnerabilities, the former asking for confirmation that their fix addressed the issues and showing a willingness to improve their security posture. Growatt also fixed the problems and released the patches in a way that should not involve any modification in the inverters, the researchers said. The report from Forescout's Vedere Labs dives deeper in the technical details of the vulnerabilities and is available here [PDF]. Based on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them."
CVE-2021-35587,2025-03-26,bleeping computer,"Despite Oracle denying a breach of its Oracle Cloud federated SSO login servers and the theft of account data for 6 million people, BleepingComputer has confirmed with multiple companies that associated data samples shared by the threat actor are valid. Last week, a person named ‘rose87168’ claimed to havebreached Oracle Cloud serversand began selling the alleged authentication data and encrypted passwords of 6 million users. The threat actor also said that stolen SSO and LDAP passwords could be decrypted using the info in the stolen files and offered to share some of the data with anyone who could help recover them. The threat actor released multiple text files consisting of a database, LDAP data, and a list of 140,621 domains for companies and government agencies that were allegedly impacted by the breach. It should be noted that some of the company domains look like tests, and there are multiple domains per company. In addition to the data, rose87168 shared anArchive.org URLwith BleepingComputer for a text file hosted on the ""login.us2.oraclecloud.com"" server that contained their email address. This file indicates that the threat actor could create files on Oracle's server, indicating an actual breach. However, Oracle has denied that it suffered a breach of Oracle Cloud and has refused to respond to any further questions about the incident. ""There has been no breach of Oracle Cloud. The published credentials are not for the Oracle Cloud. No Oracle Cloud customers experienced a breach or lost any data,"" the company told BleepingComputer last Friday. This denial, however, contradicts findings from BleepingComputer, which received additional samples of the leaked data from the threat actor and contacted the associated companies. Representatives from these companies, all who agreed to confirm the data under the promise of anonymity, confirmed the authenticity of the information. The companies stated that the associated LDAP display names, email addresses, given names, and other identifying information were all correct and belonged to them. The threat actor also shared emails with BleepingComputer, claiming to be part of an exchange between them and Oracle. One email shows the threat actor contacting Oracle's security email (secalert_us@oracle.com) to report that they hacked the servers. ""I've dug into your cloud dashboard infrastructure and found a massive vulnerability that has handed me full access to info on 6 million users,"" reads the email seen by BleepingComputer. Another email thread shared with BleepingComputer shows an exchange between the threat actor and someone using a ProtonMail email address who claims to be from Oracle. BleepingComputer has redacted the email address of this other person as we could not verify their identity or the veracity of the email thread. In this email exchange, the threat actor says someone from Oracle using a @proton.me email address told them that ""We received your emails. Let’s use this email for all communications from now on. Let me know when you get this."" Cybersecurity firm Cloudsek has alsofoundanArchive.org URLshowing that the ""login.us2.oraclecloud.com"" server was running Oracle Fusion Middleware 11g as of February 17, 2025. Oracle has since taken this server offline after news of the alleged breach was reported. This version of the software was impacted by a vulnerability tracked asCVE-2021-35587that allowed unauthenticated attackers to compromise Oracle Access Manager. The threat actor claimed that this vulnerability was used in the alleged breach of Oracle's servers. BleepingComputer has emailed Oracle numerous times about this information but has not received any response.

CVE-2025-2783,2025-03-26,bleeping computer,"​Google has fixed a high-severity Chrome zero-day vulnerability exploited to escape the browser's sandbox and deploy malware in espionage attacks targeting Russian media outlets and education organizations. ""Google is aware of reports that an exploit for CVE-2025-2783 exists in the wild,"" the company said in asecurity advisorypublished Tuesday. Tracked as CVE-2025-2783, this vulnerability was discovered by Kaspersky's Boris Larin and Igor Kuznetsov, who described it as an ""incorrect handle provided in unspecified circumstances in Mojo on Windows."" Google fixed the zero-day for users in the Stable Desktop channel, with patched versions rolling out worldwide to Windows (134.0.6998.178) users. Although the company says the security update will roll out over days and weeks, it was immediately available when BleepingComputer checked for updates. Users who prefer not to update Chrome manually can let the browser automatically check for new updates and install them after the next launch.  ​While it tagged CVE-2025-2783 as exploited in attacks, Google has yet to share further details regarding these incidents and said that ""access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix."" However, Kaspersky researchers who discovered the actively exploited zero-day also published a report with additional details, saying that attackers use CVE-2025-2783 exploits to bypass Chrome sandbox protections and infect targets with sophisticated malware. ""The vulnerability CVE-2025-2783 really left us scratching our heads, as, without doing anything obviously malicious or forbidden, it allowed the attackers to bypass Google Chrome’s sandbox protection as if it didn’t even exist,""they said. The security flaw is now being exploited in phishing attacks, redirecting victims to the primakovreadings[.]info domain as part of a cyber-espionage campaign targeting Russian organizations, dubbed Operation ForumTroll. While analyzing these attacks, Kaspersky found that the attackers also used a second exploit that enabled remote code execution on compromised systems. Although no information on this additional exploit is available, patching Chrome will disable the entire exploit chain and block potential attacks. ​The research is still ongoing, but judging by the functionality of the sophisticated malware used in the attack, Kaspersky says the attackers' goal was likely espionage. ""The malicious emails contained invitations supposedly from the organizers of a scientific and expert forum, 'Primakov Readings,' targeting media outlets, educational institutions and government organizations in Russia. Based on the content of the emails, we dubbed the campaign Operation ForumTroll,"" Larin and Kuznetsov added. CVE-2025-2783 is the first Chrome zero-day patched since the start of 2025.

CVE-2025-22224,2025-03-25,bleeping computer,"Broadcom released security updates today to fix a high-severity authentication bypass vulnerability in VMware Tools for Windows. VMware Tools is a suite of drivers and utilities designed to improve performance, graphics, and overall system integration for guest operating systems running in VMware virtual machines. The vulnerability (CVE-2025-22230) is caused by an improper access control weakness and was reported by Sergey Bliznyuk of Positive Technologies (asanctionedRussian cybersecurity company accused of trafficking hacking tools). Local attackers with low privileges can exploit it in low-complexity attacks that don't require user interaction to gain high privileges on vulnerable VMs. ""A malicious actor with non-administrative privileges on a Windows guest VM may gain ability to perform certain high-privilege operations within that VM,"" VMwareexplains in a security advisorypublished on Tuesday. Earlier this month, Broadcom alsopatched three VMware zero days(CVE-2025-22224, CVE-2025-22225, and CVE-2025-22226), which were tagged as exploited in attacks and reported by the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center. As the company explained at the time, attackers with privileged administrator or root access can chain these vulnerabilities to escape the virtual machine's sandbox. Days after patches were released, threat monitoring platform Shadowserverfound over 37,000 internet-exposed VMware ESXi instancesvulnerable to CVE-2025-22224 attacks.

CVE-2025-29927,2025-03-24,bleeping computer,"A critical severity vulnerability has been discovered in the Next.js open-source web development framework, potentially allowing attackers to bypass authorization checks. The flaw, tracked asCVE-2025-29927, enables attackers to send requests that reach destination paths without going through critical security checks. Next.js is a popular React framework with more than 9 million weekly downloadson npm. It is used for building full-stack web apps and includes middleware components for authentication and authorization. Front-end and full-stack developers use it to build web apps with React. Some of the more notable companies using it for their sites/apps are TikTok, Twitch, Hulu, Netflix, Uber, and Nike. In Next.js, middleware components run before a request hits an application routing system and serve purposes like authentication, authorization, logging, error handling, redirecting users, applying geo-blocking or rate limits. To prevent infinite loops where middleware re-triggers itself, Next.js uses a header called 'x-middleware-subrequest' that dictates if middleware functions should be applied or not. The header is retrieved by the 'runMiddleware' function responsible for processing incoming requests. If it detects the 'x-middleware-subrequest' header, with a specific value, the entire middleware execution chain is bypassed and the request is forwarded to its destination. An attacker can manually send a request that includes the header with a correct value and thus bypass protection mechanisms. According to researchersAllam Rachidand Allam Yasser (inzo_), who discovered the vulnerability and published atechnical write-up, ""the header and its value act as a universal key allowing rules to be overridden."" The vulnerability impacts all Next.js versions before 15.2.3, 14.2.25, 13.5.9. and 12.3.5. Users are recommended to upgrade to newer revisions as soon as possible, since technical details for exploiting the security issue are public. Next.js'security bulletinclarifies that CVE-2025-29927 impacts only self-hosted versions that use 'next start' with 'output: standalone'. Next.js apps apps hosted on Vercel and Nerlify, or deployed as static exports, are not affected. Also affected are environments where middleware is used for authorization or security checks and there is no validation later in the application. If patching is not possible at the time, the recommendation is to block external user requests that include the 'x-middleware-subrequest header'. Based on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.

A deserialization flaw is when an application improperly processes serialized data, allowing attackers to inject malicious objects, or gadgets, that can execute harmful code. Last year, while fixing a previous deserialization RCE flaw discovered by researcher Florian Hauser. To fix the flaw, Veeam introduced a blacklist of known classes or objects that could be exploited. However, watchTowr was able to find a different gadget chain that was not blacklisted to achieve remote code execution. ""Anyway, you've probably guessed where this is going today - it seems Veeam, despite being a ransomware gang's favourite play toy - didn't learn after the lesson given byFrycosin previous research published. You guessed it - they fixed the deserialization issues by adding entries to their deserialization blacklist."" The good news is that the flaw only impacts Veeam Backup & Replication installations that are joined to a domain. The bad news is that any domain user can exploit this vulnerability, making it easily exploitable in those configurations. Unfortunately, many companies have joined their Veeam server to a Windows domain, ignoring thecompany's long-standing best practices. Ransomware gangs havetold BleepingComputer in the pastthat Veeam Backup & Replication servers are always targets, as it allows them an easy way to steal data and block restoration efforts by deleting backups. This flaw would make Veeam installs even more valuable due to the ease with which threat actors can breach the servers. While there are no reports of this flaw being exploited in the wild, watchTowr has shared enough technical details that it would not be surprising to see a proof-of-concept (PoC) released soon. Those companies using Veeam Backup & Replication should make it a priority to upgrade to 12.3.1 as soon as possible. Furthermore, given ransomware gangs' interest in this application, it is strongly advised to review Veeam's best practices and disconnect the server from your domain.

CVE-2024-48248,2025-03-20,bleeping computer,"CISA has warned U.S. federal agencies to secure their networks against attacks exploiting a high-severity vulnerability in NAKIVO's Backup & Replication software. Tracked asCVE-2024-48248, this absolute path traversal flaw can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary files on vulnerable devices. The US-based backup and ransomware recovery software vendor silently patched the security flaw with the release ofBackup & Replication v11.0.0.88174in November, almost two months after being notified of the issue by cybersecurity company watchTowr,who discovered the vulnerability. ""Exploiting this vulnerability could expose sensitive data, including configuration files, backups, and credentials, potentially leading to data breaches or further security compromises,""NAKIVO explains. ""The possibilities are extensive depending on what's been integrated, and goes beyond merely stealing backups — to essentially unlocking entire infrastructure environments,"" watchTowr added. In February, watchTowr also released aCVE-2024-48248 proof-of-conceptdescribed as a ""detection artifact generator"" that can also serve as ""an unofficial NAKIVO customer support tool."" While NAKIVO did not mark the vulnerability as actively exploited in a security advisory last updated on March 6th, the company stilladvises customersto check the system logs for signs of ""unauthorized access attempts"" and ""unexpected file access activities."" Today, CISA added CVE-2024-48248 to itsKnown Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog, which lists security bugs flagged by the cybersecurity agency as exploited in the wild. Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies now have three weeks, until April 9th, to secure their systems against attacks, as mandated by the Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01 issued in November 2021. ""These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise,""CISA said. While BOD 22-01 only applies to federal agencies, all organizations are advised to prioritize patching this vulnerability as soon as possible to block ongoing attacks.

CVE-2025-26909,2025-03-20,bleeping computer,"Popular WordPress security plugin WP Ghost is vulnerable to a critical severity flaw that could allow unauthenticated attackers to remotely execute code and hijack servers. WP Ghost is a popular security add-on used in over 200,000 WordPress sites that claims to stop 140,000 hacker attacks and over 9 million brute-forcing attempts every month. It also offers protection against SQL injection, script injection, vulnerability exploitation, malware dropping, file inclusion exploits, directory traversal attacks, and cross-site scripting. However, as revealed by Patchstack, the security tool itself is vulnerable to a critical (CVSS score: 9.6) remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability that could lead to a complete website takeover. The flaw, tracked as CVE-2025-26909, impacts all versions of WP Ghost up to 5.4.01 and stems from insufficient input validation in the 'showFile()' function. Exploiting the flaw could allow attackers to include arbitrary files via manipulated URL paths. The flaw is triggered only if WP Ghost's ""Change Paths"" feature is set to Lite or Ghost mode. Although these modes are not enabled by default, Patchstack notes that the Local File Inclusion (LFI) part applies to nearly all setups. ""The vulnerability occurred due to insufficient user input value via the URL path that will be included as a file,""reads Patchstack's report. ""Due to the behavior of the LFI case, this vulnerability could lead to Remote Code Execution on almost all of the environment setup."" Hence, the vulnerability allows LFI universally, but whether it escalates to RCE depends on the specific server configuration. LFI without RCE can still be dangerous through scenarios such as information disclosure, session hijacking, log poisoning, access to source code, and denial of service (DoS) attacks. Following the discovery of the flaw by researcher Dimas Maulana on February 25, 2025, Patchstack analyzed it internally and eventually notified the vendor on March 3. On the next day, the developers of WP Ghost incorporated a fix in the form of an additional validation on the supplied URL or path from the users. The patch was incorporated on WP Ghost version 5.4.02, while version 5.4.03 has also been made available in the meantime. Users are recommended to upgrade to either version to mitigate CVE-2025-26909.

CVE-2024-43461,2025-03-18,bleeping computer,"At least 11 state-backed hacking groups from North Korea, Iran, Russia, and China have been exploiting a new Windows vulnerability in data theft and cyber espionage zero-day attacks since 2017. However, as security researchers Peter Girnus and Aliakbar Zahravi with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) reported today, Microsoft tagged it as ""not meeting the bar servicing"" in late September and said it wouldn't release security updates to address it. ""We discovered nearly a thousand Shell Link (.lnk) samples that exploit ZDI-CAN-25373; however, it is probable that the total number of exploitation attempts are much higher,""they said. ""Subsequently, we submitted a proof-of-concept exploit through Trend ZDI's bug bounty program to Microsoft, who declined to address this vulnerability with a security patch."" A Microsoft spokesperson was not immediately available for comment when contacted by BleepingComputer earlier today. While Microsoft has yet to assign a CVE-ID to this vulnerability, Trend Micro is tracking it internally asZDI-CAN-25373and said it enables attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected Windows systems. As the researchers found while investigating in-the-wild ZDI-CAN-25373 exploitation, the security flaw has been exploited in widespread attacks bymany state-sponsored threat groups and cybercrime gangs, including Evil Corp, APT43 (Kimsuky), Bitter, APT37, Mustang Panda, SideWinder, RedHotel, Konni, and others. Although the campaigns have targeted victims worldwide, they've been primarily focused on North America, South America, Europe, East Asia, and Australia. Out of all the attacks analyzed, nearly 70% were linked to espionage and information theft, while financial gain was the focus of only 20%. ​""Diverse malware payloads and loaders like Ursnif, Gh0st RAT, and Trickbot have been tracked in these campaigns, with malware-as-a-service (MaaS) platforms complicating the threat landscape,""Trend Micro added. This heavily exploited Windows vulnerability (tracked as ZDI-CAN-25373) is caused by a User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information (CWE-451) weakness, which allows attackers to exploit how Windows displays shortcut (.lnk) files to evade detection and execute code on vulnerable devices without the user's knowledge. Threat actors exploit ZDI-CAN-25373 by hiding malicious command-line arguments within .LNK shortcut files using padded whitespaces added to the COMMAND_LINE_ARGUMENTS structure. The researchers say these whitespaces can be in the form of hex codes for Space (\x20), Horizontal Tab (\x09), Linefeed (\x0A), Vertical Tab (\x0B), Form Feed (\x0C), and Carriage Return (\x0D) that can be used as padding. If a Windows user inspects such a .lnk file, the malicious arguments are not displayed in the Windows user interface because of the added whitespaces. As a result, the command line arguments added by the attackers remain hidden from the user's view. ""User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file,"" aTrend Micro advisoryissued today explains. ""Crafted data in an .LNK file can cause hazardous content in the file to be invisible to a user who inspects the file via the Windows-provided user interface. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current user."" This vulnerability issimilar to another flawtracked as CVE-2024-43461 that enabled threat actors to use 26 encoded braille whitespace characters (%E2%A0%80) to camouflage HTA files that can download malicious payloads as PDFs. CVE-2024-43461 was found by Peter Girnus, a Senior Threat Researcher at Trend Micro's Zero Day​​​, and patched by Microsoft during theSeptember 2024 Patch Tuesday. TheVoid BansheeAPT hacking group exploited CVE-2024-43461 in zero-day attacks to deploy information-stealing malware in campaigns against organizations across North America, Europe, and Southeast Asia. Update March 18, 13:46 EDT: A Microsoft spokesperson sent the following statement after publishing time, saying the company is considering to address the flaw in the future: We appreciate the work of ZDI in submitting this report under a coordinated vulnerability disclosure. Microsoft Defender has detections in place to detect and block this threat activity, and the Smart App Control provides an extra layer of protection by blocking malicious files from the Internet. As a security best practice, we encourage customers to exercise caution when downloading files from unknown sources as indicated in security warnings, which have been designed to recognize and warn users about potentially harmful files.

CVE-2023-34330,2025-03-18,bleeping computer,"​A new critical severity vulnerability found in American Megatrends International's MegaRAC Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) software can let attackers hijack and potentially brick vulnerable servers. MegaRAC BMC provides ""lights-out"" and ""out-of-band"" remote system management capabilities that help admins troubleshoot servers as if they were physically in front of the devices. The firmware is used by over a dozen server vendors that provide equipment to many cloud service and data center providers, including HPE, Asus, ASRock, and others. Remote unauthenticated attackers can exploit this maximum severity security flaw (tracked asCVE-2024-54085) in low-complexity attacks that don't require user interaction. ""A local or remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by accessing the remote management interfaces (Redfish) or the internal host to the BMC interface (Redfish),""Eclypsium explainedin a Tuesday report. ""Exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to remotely control the compromised server, remotely deploy malware, ransomware, firmware tampering, bricking motherboard components (BMC or potentially BIOS/UEFI), potential server physical damage (over-voltage / bricking), and indefinite reboot loops that a victim cannot stop."" Eclypsium security researchers discovered the CVE-2024-54085 auth bypass while analyzing patches issued by AMI for CVE-2023-34329, another authentication bypass the cybersecurity companydisclosed in July 2023. While Eclypsium confirmed that HPE Cray XD670, Asus RS720A-E11-RS24U, and ASRockRack are vulnerable to CVE-2024-54085 attacks if left unpatched, it also added that ""there are likely to be more affected devices and/or vendors."" Using Shodan, the security researchers found over 1,000 servers online that are potentially exposed to Internet attacks. ​As part of their research into MegaRAC vulnerabilities (collectively tracked as BMC&C), Eclypsium analystsdisclosed five more flawsin December 2022 and January 2023 (CVE-2022-40259, CVE-2022-40242, CVE-2022-2827, CVE-2022-26872, and CVE-2022-40258) that can be exploited to hijack, brick, or remotely infect compromised servers with malware. In July 2023, theyalso found a code injection vulnerability(CVE-2023-34330) that can used in attacks to inject malicious code via theRedfishremote management interfaces exposed to remote access and which can be chained with the previously discovered bugs. Specifically, CVE-2022-40258, which involves weak password hashes for Redfish & API, can help attackers crack the administrator passwords for the BMC chip's admin accounts, making the attack even more straightforward. While Eclypsium said the CVE-2024-54085 auth bypass flaw hasn't been used in attacks, and no exploits have been found in the wild, it also added that creating an exploit is ""not challenging"" given that the firmware binaries are not encrypted. Network defenders are advised to apply patches released one week ago, on March 11, byAMI,Lenovo, andHPEas soon as possible, not to expose AMI MegaRAC instances online, and to monitor server logs for suspicious activity. ""To our knowledge, the vulnerability only affects AMI's BMC software stack. However, since AMI is at the top of the BIOS supply chain, the downstream impact affects over a dozen manufacturers,"" Eclypsium added today. ""AMI has released patches to its OEM computing manufacturers' customers. Those vendors must incorporate the fixes into updates and publish notifications to their customers.

CVE-2025-30066,2025-03-17,bleeping computer,"A supply chain attack on the widely used 'tj-actions/changed-files' GitHub Action, used by 23,000 repositories, potentially allowed threat actors to steal CI/CD secrets from GitHub Actions build logs. The GitHub Action is a very popular automation tool designed for GitHub Actions workflows. It allows developers to identify files changed in a pull request or commit and take actions based on those changes, generally used in testing, workflow triggering, and automated code linting and validation. Asfirst reported by StepSecurity, attackers added a malicious commit to the tool on March 14, 2025, at 4:00 PM UTC, that dumped CI/CD secrets from the Runner Worker process to the repository of any projects using the action. As a result, if workflow logs were publicly accessible, anyone could read and steal exposed secrets. Attackers modified the action's code and retroactively updated multiple version tags to reference amalicious commit, so all versions of the tool were compromised. As per thelatest update by the developers, the attacker compromised a GitHub personal access token (PAT) used by a bot (@tj-actions-bot), which had privileged access to the tool's repository. However, it is currently unclear how exactly the PAT was compromised. On March 15, 2:00 PM UTC, GitHub removed the compromised action, and at 10:00 PM UTC on the same day, the repository was restored with the malicious code having been removed. However, the compromise has lasting repercussions for impacted software projects, so a CVE ID (CVE-2025-30066) was assigned to the incident for tracking. Strangely, the malicious code did not exfiltrate the memory output to a remote server, instead only making it visible in publicly accessible repositories. ""The compromised action injected malicious code into any CI workflows using it, dumping the CI runner memory containing the workflow secrets,""explains Wizin a write-up on the incident. ""On public repositories, the secrets would then be visible to everyone as part of the workflow logs, though obfuscated as a double-encoded base64 payload."" The restored tj-actions repository was updated earlier today toinclude instructionson what potentially impacted users need to do, which include: To prevent secrets from being exposed to similar compromises in the future, it isGitHub recommendsthat all GitHub Actions be pinged to specific commit hashes instead of version tags. Also, GitHub offers allow-listing functionality that can be leveraged to block unauthorized/non-trusted GitHub Actions. Based on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.

CVE-2025-24813,2025-03-17,bleeping computer,"A critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in Apache Tomcat tracked as CVE-2025-24813 is actively exploited in the wild, enabling attackers to take over servers with a simple PUT request. Hackers are reportedly leveraging proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits that were published on GitHub just 30 hours after the flaw was disclosed last week. The malicious activity was confirmed by Wallarm security researchers, who warned that traditional security tools fail to detect it as PUT requests appear normal and the malicious content is obfuscated using base64 encoding. Specifically, the attacker sends a PUT request containing a base64-encoded serialized Java payload saved to Tomcat's session storage. The attacker then sends a GET request with a JSESSIONID cookie pointing to the uploaded session file, forcing Tomcat to deserialize and execute the malicious Java code, granting complete control to the attacker. The attack does not require authentication and is caused by Tomcat accepting partial PUT requests and its default session persistence. ""This attack is dead simple to execute and requires no authentication,""explains Wallarm. ""The only requirement is that Tomcat is using file-based session storage, which is common in many deployments. Worse, base64 encoding allows the exploit to bypass most traditional security filters, making detection challenging."" TheCVE-2025-24813remote code execution vulnerability flaw was first disclosed by Apache on March 10, 2025, impacting Apache Tomcat 11.0.0-M1 to 11.0.2, 10.1.0-M1 to 10.1.34, and 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.98. Thesecurity bulletinwarned users that, under certain conditions, an attacker could view or inject arbitrary content on security-sensitive files. The conditions were the following: Apache recommended that all users upgrade to Tomcat versions 11.0.3+, 10.1.35+, or 9.0.99+, which are patched against CVE-2025-24813. Tomcat users may also mitigate the problem by reverting to the default servlet configuration (readonly= ""true""), turning off partial PUT support, and avoiding storing security-sensitive files in a subdirectory of public upload paths. Wallarm warns that the bigger issue highlighted in this case isn't the exploitation activity itself but the potential for more RCE vulnerabilities arising from the partial PUT handling in Tomcat. ""Attackers will soon start shifting their tactics, uploading malicious JSP files, modifying configurations, and planting backdoors outside session storage. This is just the first wave,"" cautioned Wallarm. Based on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.

CVE-2025-20115,2025-03-14,bleeping computer,"Cisco has patched a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability that lets attackers crash the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) process on IOS XR routers with a single BGP update message. IOS XRruns on the company's carrier-grade, Network Convergence System (NCS), and Carrier Routing System (CRS) series of routers, such as the ASR 9000, NCS 5500, and 8000 series. This high-severity flaw (tracked asCVE-2025-20115) was found in the confederation implementation for the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), and it only affects Cisco IOS XR devices if BGP confederation is configured. Successful exploitation allows unauthenticated attackers to take down vulnerable devices remotely in low-complexity attacks by causing memory corruption via buffer overflow, leading to a BGP process restart. ""This vulnerability is due to a memory corruption that occurs when a BGP update is created with an AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE attribute that has 255 autonomous system numbers (AS numbers),"" the companyexplains in a security advisoryissued this week. ""An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted BGP update message, or the network could be designed in such a manner that the AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE attribute grows to 255 AS numbers or more."" To exploit the CVE-2025-20115 vulnerability, ""the network must be designed in such a manner that the AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE attribute grows to 255 AS numbers or more,"" or the attackers must have control of a BGP confederation speaker within the same autonomous system as the targeted device(s). Those who can't immediately apply the security patches released earlier this week are advised to restrict the BGP AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE attribute to 254 or fewer AS numbers to limit potential attacks' impact. ""While this workaround has been deployed and was proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions,"" Cisco said. The company's Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) found no evidence that this vulnerability has been exploited in the wild, but Cisco saysa write-uppublished in September on APNIC's blog provides additional CVE-2025-20115 technical details. Earlier this month, Ciscowarned customersof a vulnerability in Webex for BroadWorks that can let unauthenticated attackers access credentials remotely. The same week,CISA taggeda remote command execution security flaw impacting Cisco RV016, RV042, RV042G, RV082, RV320, and RV325 VPN routers as actively exploited in attacks and ordered U.S. federal agencies to secure any vulnerable devices by March 23. ""Cisco continues to strongly recommend that customers upgrade their hardware to Meraki or Cisco 1000 Series Integrated Services Routers to remediate these vulnerabilities,""the company urgedin an advisory updated days after CISA's order was issued.

CVE-2025-2447,2025-03-13,bleeping computer,"A new ransomware operator named 'Mora_001' is exploiting two Fortinet vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to firewall appliances and deploy a custom ransomware strain dubbed SuperBlack. The two vulnerabilities, both authentication bypasses, are CVE-2024-55591 and CVE-2025-24472, which Fortinet disclosed in January and February, respectively. When Fortinet first disclosed CVE-2024-55591 on January 14, they confirmed it had beenexploited as a zero-day, with Arctic Wolf stating it had beenused in attacks since November 2024to breach FortiGate firewalls. Confusingly, on February 11, Fortinet added CVE-2025-2447 to theirJanuary advisory, which led many to believe it was a newly exploited flaw. However,Fortinet told BleepingComputerthat this bug was also fixed in January 2024 and was not exploited. ""We are not aware of CVE-2025-24472 ever being exploited,"" Fortinet told BleepingComputer at the time. However, a new report byForescout researchers, says they discovered the SuperBlack attacks in late January 2025, with the threat actor utilizing CVE-2025-24472 as early as February 2, 2025. ""While Forescout itself did not directly report the 24472 exploitation to Fortinet, as one of the affected organizations we worked with was sharing findings from our investigation with Fortinet's PSIRT team,"" Forescout told BleepingComputer. ""Shortly afterward, Fortinet updated their advisory on February 11 to acknowledge CVE-2025-24472 as actively exploited."" BleepingComputer contacted Fortinet to clarify this point, but we are still waiting for a response. Forescout says the Mora_001 ransomware operator follows a highly structured attack chain that doesn't vary much across victims. First, the attacker gains 'super_admin' privileges by exploiting the two Fortinet flaws using WebSocket-based attacks via the jsconsole interface or sending direct HTTPS requests to exposed firewall interfaces. Next, they create new administrator accounts (forticloud-tech, fortigate-firewall, adnimistrator) and modify automation tasks to recreate those if removed. After this, the attacker maps the network and attempts lateral movement using stolen VPN credentials and newly added VPN accounts, Windows Management Instrumentation (WMIC) & SSH, and TACACS+/RADIUS authentication. Mora_001 steals data using a custom tool before encrypting files for double extortion, prioritizing file and database servers and domain controllers. After the encryption process, ransom notes are dropped on the victim's system. A custom-built wiper called 'WipeBlack' is then deployed to remove all traces of ransomware executable to hinder forensic analysis. Forescout has found extensive evidence indicating strong links between the SuperBlack ransomware operation and LockBit ransomware, although the former appears to act independently. The first element is that the SuperBlack encryptor [VirusTotal] is based on LockBit's 3.0 leaked builder, featuring identical payload structure and encryption methods, but will all original branding striped. Secondly, SuperBlack's ransom note includes a TOX chat ID linked to LockBit operations, suggesting that Mora_001 is either a former LockBit affiliate or a former member of its core team managing ransom payments and negotiations. The third element suggesting a link is the extensive IP address overlaps with previous LockBit operations. Also, WipeBlack has also been leveraged by BrainCipher ransomware, EstateRansomware, and SenSayQ ransomware, all tied to LockBit.

CVE-2025-21590,2025-03-13,bleeping computer,"​Juniper Networks has released emergency security updates to patch a Junos OS vulnerability exploited by Chinese hackers to backdoor routers for stealthy access. This medium severity flaw (CVE-2025-21590) was reported by Amazon security engineer Matteo Memelli and is caused by animproper isolation or compartmentalizationweakness. Successful exploitation lets local attackers with high privileges execute arbitrary code on vulnerable routers to compromise the devices' integrity. ""At least one instance of malicious exploitation (not at Amazon) has been reported to the Juniper SIRT. Customers are encouraged to upgrade to a fixed release as soon as it's available and in the meantime take steps to mitigate this vulnerability,"" Juniperwarned in an out-of-cycle security advisoryissued on Wednesday, ""While the complete list of resolved platforms is under investigation, it is strongly recommended to mitigate the risk of exploitation by restricting shell access to trusted users only."" The vulnerability impacts NFX-Series, Virtual SRX, SRX-Series Branch, SRX-Series HE, EX-Series, QFX-Series, ACX, and MX-Series devices and was resolved in 21.4R3-S10, 22.2R3-S6, 22.4R3-S6, 23.2R2-S3, 24.2R1-S2, 24.2R2, 24.4R1, and all subsequent releases. CISA alsoadded CVE-2025-21590to itscatalog of actively exploited vulnerabilitieson Thursday, ordering Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to secure vulnerable Juniper devices by April 3rd as mandated byBinding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01. ""These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise,"" the U.S. cybersecurity agency said. Juniper's advisory was released the same dayas a Mandiant reportrevealing that Chinese hackers have exploited the security flaw since 2024 to backdoor vulnerable Juniper routers that reached end-of-life (EoL). All six backdoors deployed in this campaign had distinct C2 communication methods and used a separate set of hardcoded C2 server addresses. ""In mid 2024, Mandiant discovered threat actors deployed custom backdoors operating on Juniper Networks' Junos OS routers,"" the cybersecurity company explained. ""Mandiant attributed these backdoors to the China-nexus espionage group, UNC3886. Mandiant uncovered several TINYSHELL based backdoors operating on Juniper Networks' Junos OS routers."" UNC3886 is known for orchestrating sophisticated attacks exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities in edge networking devices and virtualization platforms. Earlier this year, Black Lotus Labs researchers said that unknown threat actors have been targeting Juniper edge devices (many acting as VPN gateways)with J-magic malwarethat opens a reverse shell if it detects a ""magic packet"" in the network traffic. The J-magic campaign was active between mid-2023 and at least mid-2024, and its goal was to gain long-term access to the compromised devices while evading detection. Black Lotus Labs linked this malware with ""low confidence"" to theSeaSpy backdoor.

GitLab.com is already patched, and GitLab Dedicated customers will be updated automatically, but users who maintain self-managed installations on their own infrastructure will need to apply the updates manually. ""We strongly recommend that all installations running a version affected by the issues described below are upgraded to the latest version as soon as possible,""warns the bulletin. The two critical flaws GitLab addressed this time areCVE-2025-25291andCVE-2025-25292, both in the ruby-saml library, which is used for SAML Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication at the instance or group level. These vulnerabilities allow an authenticated attacker with access to a valid signed SAML document to impersonate another user within the same SAML Identity Provider (IdP) environment. This means an attacker could gain unauthorized access to another user's account, leading to potential data breaches, privilege escalation, and other security risks. GitHub discovered the ruby-saml bugs and has published a technical deep dive into the two flaws, noting that its platform hasn't been impacted as the use of the ruby-saml library stopped in 2014. ""GitHub doesn't currently use ruby-saml for authentication, but began evaluating the use of the library with the intention of using an open source library for SAML authentication once more,""explains GitHub's writeup. ""This library is, however, used in other popular projects and products. We discovered an exploitable instance of this vulnerability in GitLab, and have notified their security team so they can take necessary actions to protect their users against potential attacks."" Of the rest of the issues fixed by GitLab, one that stands out is a high-severity remote code execution issue tracked underCVE-2025-27407. The flaw allows an attacker-controlled authenticated user to exploit the Direct Transfer feature, which is disabled by default, to achieve remote code execution.

CVE-2025-27363,2025-03-12,bleeping computer,"Facebook is warning that a FreeType vulnerability in all versions up to 2.13 can lead to arbitrary code execution, with reports that the flaw has been exploited in attacks. FreeType is a popular open-source font rendering library used to display text and programmatically add text to images. It provides functionality to load, rasterize, and render fonts in various formats, such as TrueType (TTF), OpenType (OTF), and others. The library is installed in millions of systems and services, including Linux, Android, game engines, GUI frameworks, and online platforms. The vulnerability, tracked underCVE-2025-27363and given a CVSS v3 severity score of 8.1 (""high""), was fixed in FreeType version 2.13.0 on February 9th, 2023. Facebook disclosed the flaw yesterday, warning that the vulnerability is exploitable in all versions of FreeType up to version 2.13 and that there are reports of it actively being exploited in attacks. ""An out of bounds write exists in FreeType versions 2.13.0 and below when attempting to parse font subglyph structures related to TrueType GX and variable font files,""reads the bulletin. ""The vulnerable code assigns a signed short value to an unsigned long and then adds a static value causing it to wrap around and allocate too small of a heap buffer."" ""The code then writes up to 6 signed long integers out of bounds relative to this buffer. This may result in arbitrary code execution."" Facebook may rely on FreeType in some capacity, but it is unclear if the attacks seen by its security team took place on its platform or if they discovered them elsewhere. Considering the widespread use of FreeType across multiple platforms, software developers and project administrators must upgrade to FreeType 2.13.3 (latest version) as soon as possible. Although the latest vulnerable version (2.13.0) dates two years, older library versions can persist in software projectsfor extended periods, making it important to address the flaw as soon as possible. BleepingComputer asked Meta about the flaw and how it was exploited, and was sent the following statement. ""We report security bugs in open source software when we find them because it strengthens online security for everyone,"" Facebook told BleepingComputer.

CVE-2025-24983,2025-03-12,bleeping computer,"Slovak cybersecurity company ESET says a newly patched zero-day vulnerability in the Windows Win32 Kernel Subsystem has been exploited in attacks since March 2023. Fixed in Windows security updates released duringthis month's Patch Tuesday, the security flaw is now tracked as CVE-2025-24983 and was reported to Microsoft by ESET researcher Filip Jurčacko. The vulnerability is caused by a use-after-free weakness that lets attackers with low privileges gain SYSTEM privileges without requiring user interaction. However, Redmond tagged such attacks as high complexity since successful exploitation requires the threat actors to win a race condition. ESET said on Tuesday that a zero-day exploit targeting the CVE-2025-24983 vulnerability was ""first seen in the wild"" in March 2023 on systems backdoored using PipeMagic malware. This exploit targets only older Windows versions (Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows 8.1) that Microsoft no longer supports. However, the vulnerability also affects newer Windows versions, including the still-supported Windows Server 2016 and Windows 10 systems running Windows 10 build 1809 and earlier. ""The Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerability is related to improper memory usage during software operation. This can lead to software crashes, execution of malicious code (including remotely), privilege escalation, or data corruption,"" ESET also told BleepingComputer. ""The exploit was deployed via the PipeMagic backdoor, capable of exfiltrating data and enabling remote access to the machine."" PipeMagic wasdiscovered by Kaspersky in 2022, and it can be used to harvest sensitive data, provides the attackers with full remote access to infected devices, and enables them to deploy additional malicious payloads to move laterally through the victims' networks.

CVE-2023-28252,2025-03-12,bleeping computer,"Slovak cybersecurity company ESET says a newly patched zero-day vulnerability in the Windows Win32 Kernel Subsystem has been exploited in attacks since March 2023.

CVE-2022-41328,2025-03-12,bleeping computer,"Chinese hackers are deploying custom backdoors on Juniper Networks Junos OS MX routers that have reached end-of-life (EoL) and no longer receive security updates. The backdoors are primarily variants of the TinyShell malware, an open-source tool that facilitates data exchange and command execution on Linux systems, and which has been used bymultiple threat groupsover the years. The attacks were discovered in mid-2024 by Mandiant, who attributed the attacks to a cyberespionage threat actor known as UNC3886. ""In mid 2024, Mandiant discovered threat actors deployed custom backdoors operating on Juniper Networks' Junos OS routers,"" explains anew report by Mandiant. ""Mandiant attributed these backdoors to the China-nexus espionage group, UNC3886. Mandiant uncovered several TINYSHELL based backdoors operating on Juniper Networks' Junos OS routers."" This threat actor is known for sophisticated attacks utilizing zero-day vulnerabilities to compromise virtualization platforms and edge networking devices. In 2023, Chinese hackers were behind a series of attacks on government organizationsusing a Fortinet zero-day vulnerability(CVE-2022-41328) to deploy custom backdoors. Later that year, the threat actorsexploited a VMware ESXi zero-dayvulnerability to backdoor ESXi hosts. Mandiant has observed UNC3886 attacks starting from terminal servers used for managing network devices, where the threat actors used compromised credentials to access the Junos OS CLI and escalate to FreeBSD shell mode. The researchers note that Junos OS has a file integrity system named 'Veriexec' that prevents unauthorized code from running on devices. However, they discovered that code injected into trusted processes could still be executed. ""Veriexec protection prevents unauthorized binaries from executing. This poses a challenge for threat actors, as disabling veriexec can trigger alerts,"" explains the Mandiant researchers. ""However, execution of untrusted code is still possible if it occurs within the context of a trusted process. Mandiant's investigation revealed that UNC3886 was able to circumvent this protection by injecting malicious code into the memory of a legitimate process."" Utilizing this method, UNC3886 installed the six custom backdoors on the MX routers, all based on TinyShell: For stealth and persistence, each of the six backdoors used by UNC3886 in the attacks has a distinct C2 communication method and uses a separate set of hardcoded C2 server addresses. Given that UNC3886 targets end-of-life Juniper MX routers, the priority should be replacing these devices with new models that are actively supported and then upgrading those to the latest firmware. Although Juniper did not release fixes this time, the vendorpublished a bulletinthat includes mitigation recommendations and updated signatures for its Juniper Malware Removal Tool (JMRT). System administrators should also strengthen authentication security by using a centralized Identity & Access Management (IAM) system and enforcing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all network devices. A complete list of the indicators of compromise (IoCs) related to this campaign and YARA and Snort/Suricata rules are provided at the bottom of Mandiant's report. Juniper routers were also previously targeted inJ-Magic malware attacksthat opened a reverse shell to the device when it received specially crafted packets. This campaign was designed for low-detection and long-term access to corporate networks.  Based on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.

The actively exploited zero-day vulnerability in today's updates are: CVE-2025-24983- Windows Win32 Kernel Subsystem Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability Microsoft says this vulnerability will allow local attackers to gain SYSTEM privileges on the device after winning a race condition. Microsoft has not shared how the flaw was exploited in attacks. However, as it was discovered by Filip Jurčacko with ESET, we will likely learn more in a future report. BleepingComputer contacted ESET for more information about this flaw. CVE-2025-24984- Windows NTFS Information Disclosure Vulnerability Microsoft says that this flaw can be exploited by attackers who have physical access to the device and insert a malicious USB drive. Exploiting the flaw allows the attackers to read portions of heap memory and steal information. Microsoft says that this vulnerability was disclosed anonymously. CVE-2025-24985- Windows Fast FAT File System Driver Remote Code Execution Vulnerability Microsoft says that this remote code execution vulnerability is caused by an integer overflow or wraparound in Windows Fast FAT Driver that, when exploited, allows an attacker to execute code. ""An attacker can trick a local user on a vulnerable system into mounting a specially crafted VHD that would then trigger the vulnerability,"" explains Microsoft. While Microsoft has not shared details about how it was exploited but malicious VHD images were previously distributed inphishing attacksand throughpirated software sites. Microsoft says that this vulnerability was disclosed anonymously. CVE-2025-24991- Windows NTFS Information Disclosure Vulnerability Microsoft says that attackers can exploit this flaw to read small portions heap memory and steal information. Attackers can exploit the flaw by tricking a user into mounting a malicious VHD file. Microsoft says that this vulnerability was disclosed anonymously. CVE-2025-24993- Windows NTFS Remote Code Execution Vulnerability Microsoft says that this remote code execution vulnerability is caused by a heap-based buffer overflow bug in Windows NTFS that allows an attacker to execute code. ""An attacker can trick a local user on a vulnerable system into mounting a specially crafted VHD that would then trigger the vulnerability,"" explains Microsoft Microsoft says that this vulnerability was disclosed anonymously. CVE-2025-26633- Microsoft Management Console Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability While Microsoft has not shared any details about this flaw, based on its description, it may involve a bug that allows malicious Microsoft Management Console (.msc) files to bypass Windows security features and execute code. ""In an email or instant message attack scenario, the attacker could send the targeted user a specially crafted file that is designed to exploit the vulnerability,"" explains Microsoft. ""In any case an attacker would have no way to force a user to view attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince a user to take action. For example, an attacker could entice a user to either click a link that directs the user to the attacker's site or send a malicious attachment."" Microsoft says Aliakbar Zahravi from Trend Micro discovered this flaw. BleepingComputer contacted Trend Micro to learn more about how this flaw was exploited. The publicly disclosed zero-day is: CVE-2025-26630- Microsoft Access Remote Code Execution Vulnerability Microsoft says this remote code execution flaw is caused by a use after free memory bug in Microsoft Office Access. To exploit the flaw, a user must be tricked into opening a specially crafted Access file. This can be done through phishing or social engineering attacks. However, the flaw cannot be exploited through the preview pane. Microsoft says the flaw was discovered by Unpatched.ai.

CVE-2024-4577,2025-03-11,bleeping computer,"Threat intelligence company GreyNoise warns that a critical PHP remote code execution vulnerability that impacts Windows systems is now under mass exploitation. Tracked asCVE-2024-4577, this PHP-CGI argument injection flaw waspatched in June 2024and affects Windows PHP installations with PHP running in CGI mode. Successful exploitation enables unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code and leads to complete system compromise following successful exploitation. A day after PHP maintainers released CVE-2024-4577 patches on June 7, 2024, WatchTowr Labs released proof-of-concept (PoC)exploit code, and the Shadowserver Foundation reportedobserving exploitation attempts. GreyNoise's warning comes after Cisco Talosrevealed earlierthat an unknown attacker had exploited the same PHP vulnerability to target Japanese organizations since at least early January 2025. While Talos observed the attackers attempting to steal credentials, it believes their goals extend beyond just credential harvesting, based on post-exploitation activities, which include establishing persistence, elevating privileges to SYSTEM level, deployment of adversarial tools and frameworks, and usage of ""TaoWu"" Cobalt Strike kit plugins. However, as GreyNoise reported, the threat actors behind this malicious activity cast a much wider net by targeting vulnerable devices globally, with significant increases observed in the United States, Singapore, Japan, and other countries since January 2025. In January alone, its worldwide network of honeypots known as Global Observation Grid (GOG)spotted 1,089 unique IP addressesattempting to exploit this PHP security flaw. ""While initial reports focused on attacks in Japan, GreyNoise data confirms that exploitation is far more widespread [..] More than 43% of IPs targeting CVE-2024-4577 in the past 30 days are from Germany and China,"" the threat intelligence firmsaid, warning that at least 79 exploits are available online. ""In February, GreyNoise detected a coordinated spike in exploitation attempts against networks in multiple countries, suggesting additional automated scanning for vulnerable targets."" Previously, CVE-2024-4577 was exploited by unknown attackers whobackdoored a university's Windows systems in Taiwanwith newly discovered malware dubbed Msupedge.

CVE-2025-27840,2025-03-08,bleeping computer,"Update 3/9/25: After receiving concerns about the use of the term 'backdoor' to refer to these undocumented commands, we have updated our title and story. Our original story can be foundhere. The ubiquitous ESP32 microchip made by Chinese manufacturer Espressif and used by over 1 billion units as of 2023 contains undocumented commands that could be leveraged for attacks. The undocumented commands allow spoofing of trusted devices, unauthorized data access, pivoting to other devices on the network, and potentially establishing long-term persistence. This was discovered by Spanish researchers Miguel Tarascó Acuña and Antonio Vázquez Blanco of Tarlogic Security, whopresentedtheir findings yesterday atRootedCONin Madrid. ""Tarlogic Security has detected a backdoor in the ESP32, a microcontroller that enables WiFi and Bluetooth connection and is present in millions of mass-market IoT devices,"" reads aTarlogic announcementshared with BleepingComputer. ""Exploitation of this backdoor would allow hostile actors to conduct impersonation attacks and permanently infect sensitive devices such as mobile phones, computers, smart locks or medical equipment by bypassing code audit controls."" The researchers warned that ESP32 is one of the world's most widely used chips for Wi-Fi + Bluetooth connectivity in IoT (Internet of Things) devices, so the risk is significant. In their RootedCON presentation, the Tarlogic researchers explained that interest in Bluetooth security research has waned but not because the protocol or its implementation has become more secure. Instead, most attacks presented last year didn't have working tools, didn't work with generic hardware, and used outdated/unmaintained tools largely incompatible with modern systems. Tarlogic developed a new C-based USB Bluetooth driver that is hardware-independent and cross-platform, allowing direct access to the hardware without relying on OS-specific APIs. Armed with this new tool, which enables raw access to Bluetooth traffic, Tarlogic discovered hidden vendor-specific commands (Opcode 0x3F) in the ESP32 Bluetooth firmware that allow low-level control over Bluetooth functions. In total, they found 29 undocumented commands, collectively characterized as a ""backdoor,"" that could be used for memory manipulation (read/write RAM and Flash), MAC address spoofing (device impersonation), and LMP/LLCP packet injection. Espressif has not publicly documented these commands, so either they weren't meant to be accessible, or they were left in by mistake. The issue is now tracked underCVE-2025-27840. The risks arising from these commands include malicious implementations on the OEM level and supply chain attacks. Depending on how Bluetooth stacks handle HCI commands on the device, remote exploitation of the commands might be possible via malicious firmware or rogue Bluetooth connections. This is especially the case if an attacker already has root access, planted malware, or pushed a malicious update on the device that opens up low-level access. In general, though, physical access to the device's USB or UART interface would be far riskier and a more realistic attack scenario. ""In a context where you can compromise an IOT device with as ESP32 you will be able to hide an APT inside the ESP memory and perform Bluetooth (or Wi-Fi) attacks against other devices, while controlling the device over Wi-Fi/Bluetooth,"" explained the researchers to BleepingComputer. ""Our findings would allow to fully take control over the ESP32 chips and to gain persistence in the chip via commands that allow for RAM and Flash modification."" ""Also, with persistence in the chip, it may be possible to spread to other devices because the ESP32 allows for the execution of advanced Bluetooth attacks."" BleepingComputer has contacted Espressif for a statement on the researchers' findings, but a comment wasn't immediately available. Update 3/10/25:Espressif published a statement Monday in response to Tarlogic's findings, stating that the undocumented commands are debug commands used for internal testing. ""The functionality found are debug commands included for testing purposes,""reads Espressif's statement. ""These debug commands are part of Espressif’s implementation of the HCI (Host Controller Interface) protocol used in Bluetooth technology. This protocol is used internally in a product to communicate between Bluetooth layers."" Despite the low risk, the vendor stated that it will remove the debug commands in a future software update. ""While these debug commands exist, they cannot, by themselves, pose a security risk to ESP32 chips. Espressif will still provide a software fix to remove these undocumented commands,"" says Espressif.

CVE-2025-1316,2025-03-07,bleeping computer,"A critical command injection vulnerability impacting the Edimax IC-7100 IP camera is currently being exploited by botnet malware to compromise devices. The flaw was discovered by Akamai researchers, who confirmed to BleepingComputer that the flaw is exploited in attacks that are still ongoing. Akamai researcher Kyle Lefton told BleepingComputer that they will provide more technical details about the flaw and the associated botnet next week. After discovering the flaw, Akamai reported it to theU.S. Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Agency (CISA), who attempted to contact the Taiwanese vendor. ""Both Akamai SIRT and CISA attempted to contact the vendor (Edimax) multiple times. CISA was unable to get a response from them,"" Lefton told BleepingComputer.com. ""I personally reached out to them and received a response, but all they said was that the device in question, IC-7100, was end of life, therefore not receiving further updates. As Edimax was unable to provide us with more information, it is possible that this CVE affects a wider range of devices, and it is unlikely that a patch will released."" The Edimax IC-7100 is an IP security camera for remote surveillance at homes, small office buildings, commercial facilities, and industrial settings. The product isn't widely available in retail channels anymore. It was released in October 2011, and Edimax lists it under its 'legacy products,' suggesting it's no longer produced and is likely no longer supported. However, a significant number of those devices may still be used across the globe. The Edimax vulnerability is tracked asCVE-2025-1316and is a critical severity (CVSS v4.0 score 9.3) OS command injection flaw caused by the improper neutralization of incoming requests. A remote attacker can exploit this flaw and gain remote code execution by sending specially crafted requests to the device. In this case, the current exploitation is being performed by botnet malware to compromise the devices. Botnets typically use these devices to launch distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, proxy malicious traffic, or pivot to other devices on the same network. Given the situation and active exploitation status for CVE-2025-1316, impacted devices should be taken offline or replaced with actively supported products. CISA recommends that users minimize internet exposure for impacted devices, place them behind firewalls, and isolate them from critical business networks. Moreover, the U.S. agency recommends using up-to-date Virtual Private Network (VPN) products for secure remote access when required. Common signs of compromised IoT devices include performance degradation, excessive heating, unexpected changes in device settings, and atypical/anomalous network traffic.

CVE-2023-3519,2025-03-05,bleeping computer,"Microsoft warns that Chinese cyber-espionage threat group 'Silk Typhoon' has shifted its tactics, now targeting remote management tools and cloud services in supply chain attacks that give them access to downstream customers. The tech giant has confirmed breaches across multiple industries, including government, IT services, healthcare, defense, education, NGOs, and energy. ""They [Silk Typhoon] exploit unpatched applications that allow them to elevate their access in targeted organizations and conduct further malicious activities,""reads Microsoft's report. ""After successfully compromising a victim, Silk Typhoon uses the stolen keys and credentials to infiltrate customer networks where they can then abuse a variety of deployed applications, including Microsoft services and others, to achieve their espionage objectives."" Silk Typhoon is a Chinese state-sponsored espionage group known forhacking the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control(OFAC) office in early December 2024 andstealing datafrom the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). Microsoft reports that Silk Typhoon switched tactics around that period, abusing stolen API keys and compromised credentials for IT providers, identity management, privileged access management, and RMM solutions, which are then used to access downstream customer networks and data. Microsoft says the attackers scan GitHub repositories and other public resources to locate leaked authentication keys or credentials and then use them to breach environments. The threat actors are also known for using password spray attacks to gain access to valid credentials. Previously, the threat actors were primarily leveraging zero-day and n-day flaws in public-facing edge devices to gain initial access, plant web shells, and then move laterally via compromised VPNs and RDPs. Switching from organization-level breaches to MSP-level hacks allows the attackers to move within cloud environments, stealing Active Directory sync credentials (AADConnect), and abusing OAuth applications for a much stealthier attack. The threat actors no longer rely on malware and web shells, with Silk Typhoon now exploiting cloud apps to steal data and then clear logs, leaving only a minimal trace behind. According to Microsoft's observations, Silk Typhoon continues to exploit vulnerabilities alongside its new tactics, sometimes as zero days, for initial access. Most recently, the threat groupwas observedexploiting a critical Ivanti Pulse Connect VPN privilege escalation flaw (CVE-2025-0282) as a zero-day to breach corporate networks. Earlier, in 2024, Silk Typhoon exploited CVE-2024-3400, a command injection vulnerability in Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect, and CVE-2023-3519, a remote code execution flaw in Citrix NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway.

""A low-severity vulnerability in Cisco Webex for BroadWorks Release 45.2 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access data and credentials if unsecure transport is configured for the SIP communication,""Cisco explained. ""A related issue could allow an authenticated user to access credentials in plain text in the client and server logs. A malicious actor could exploit this vulnerability and the related issue to access data and credentials and impersonate the user."" The vulnerability is caused by sensitive information exposed in the SIP headers and only affects Cisco BroadWorks (on-premises) and Cisco Webex for BroadWorks (hybrid cloud/on-premises) instances running in Windows environments. The company advises admins to configure secure transport for SIP communication to encrypt data in transit as a temporary workaround until the configuration change reaches their environment. ""Cisco also recommends rotating credentials to protect against the possibility that the credentials have been acquired by a malicious actor,"" the company added.

""An attacker with local access to a device can exploit these vulnerabilities to escalate privileges or cause a denial-of-service (DoS) scenario on the victim's machine,"" explains a warning from CERT/CC. ""Additionally, as the attack involves a Microsoft-signed Driver, an attacker can leverage a Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) technique to exploit systems even if Paragon Partition Manager is not installed. "" As BioNTdrv.sys is a kernel-level driver, threat actors can exploit vulnerabilities to execute commands with the same privileges as the driver, bypassing protections and security software. Microsoft researchers discovered all five flaws, noting that one of them, CVE-2025-0289, is leveraged in attacks by ransomware groups. However, the researchers did not disclose what ransomware gangs were exploiting the flaw as a zero-day. ""Microsoft has observed threat actors (TAs) exploiting this weakness in BYOVD ransomware attacks, specifically using CVE-2025-0289 to achieve privilege escalation to SYSTEM level, then execute further malicious code,""reads the CERT/CC bulletin. ""These vulnerabilities have been patched by both Paragon Software, and vulnerable BioNTdrv.sys versions blocked by Microsoft's Vulnerable Driver Blocklist."" The Paragon Partition Manager flaws discovered by Microsoft are: The first four vulnerabilities impact Paragon Partition Manager versions 7.9.1 and previous, while CVE-2025-0298, the actively exploited flaw, impacts version 17 and older. Users of the software are recommended to upgrade to the latest version, which contains BioNTdrv.sys version 2.0.0, which addresses all of the mentioned flaws. However, it's important to note that even users who don't have Paragon Partition Manager installed are not safe from attacks. BYOVD tactics don't rely on the software being present on the target's machine. Instead, threat actors include the vulnerable driver with their own tools, allowing them to load it into Windows and escalate privileges. Microsoft has updated its 'Vulnerable Driver Blocklist' to block the driver from loading in Windows, so users and organizations should verify the protection system is active. You can check if the blocklist is enabled by going toSettings→Privacy & security→Windows Security→Device security→Core isolation→Microsoft Vulnerable Driver Blocklistand making sure the setting is enabled. A warning on Paragon Software's site also warns that users must upgrade Paragon Hard Disk Manager by today, as it utilizes the same driver, which will be blocked by Microsoft today. While it is unclear what ransomware gangs are exploiting the Paragon flaw, BYOVD attacks have become increasingly popular among cybercriminals as they allow them to easily gain SYSTEM privileges on Windows devices. Threat actors known to be utilizing BYOVD attacks includeScattered Spider,Lazarus,BlackByte ransomware,LockBit ransomware, and many more.

CVE-2024-34331,2025-02-24,bleeping computer,"Two different exploits for an unpatched Parallels Desktop privilege elevation vulnerability have been publicly disclosed, allowing users to gain root access on impacted Mac devices. Parallels Desktop is a virtualization software that allows Mac users to run Windows, Linux, and other operating systems alongside macOS. It is very popular among developers, businesses, and casual users who need Windows applications on their Macs without rebooting. Security researcher Mickey Jin published the exploits last week, demonstrating a bypass of the vendor's fixes forCVE-2024-34331, a privilege elevation flaw fixed in September. That flaw, first discovered in May 2024by Mykola Grymalyuk, stemmed from a lack of code signature verification in Parallels Desktop for Mac. Jin says he released the exploits for the zero-day patch bypass after the developer allegedly left it unfixed for over seven months. ""Given that the vendor has left this vulnerability unaddressed for over seven months—despite prior disclosure—I have chosen to publicly disclose this 0-day exploit,"" explains Jin in atechnical writeup. ""My goal is to raise awareness and urge users to mitigate risks proactively, as attackers could leverage this flaw in the wild."" Parallels' original patch attempted to prevent untrusted code execution by verifying whether the 'createinstallmedia' tool is Apple-signed before granting it root privileges. However, Jin demonstrated that this verification is flawed, allowing attackers to bypass it in at least two ways. The first is to perform a time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) attack to exploit a race condition between checking if 'createinstallmedia' is Apple-signed and executing it with root privileges. An attacker drops a fake macOS installer, waits for Parallels to verify the Apple-signed 'createinstallmedia' binary, and then quickly replaces it with a malicious script before execution, gaining root privileges. The second exploit is an attack via the 'do_repack_manual' function that is vulnerable to arbitrary root-own file overwrites. By manipulating the 'do_repack_manual' function, an attacker redirects a privileged folder using symlinks, tricks Parallels into writing attacker-controlled files to a root-owned path, and replaces 'p7z_tool,' which gets executed as root. Jin discovered the potential bypasses soon after reading Mykola's writeup and informed Parallels in June 2024. The researcher says the vendor promised to look into his report, but despite three subsequent requests for an update (the last one was on February 19, 2025), Parallels didn't respond. The researcher warns that his first exploit, involving the TOCTOU attack, works on the latest version of Parallels, 20.2.1 (55876), and all versions from 19.4.0 and older. Parallels modified the repacking process in version 19.4.1, switching from 'do_repack_createinstallmedia' to 'do_repack_manual,' breaking the exploit. However, this change introduced a new vulnerability that allows an attacker to overwrite arbitrary root-owned files, making the second exploit possible. The changes were reverted in the latest version (20.2.1), so the exploit is now working again. In conclusion, all known versions of Parallels Desktop, including the latest, are vulnerable to at least one exploit. BleepingComputer has contacted Parallels requesting a comment on Jin's findings and report, but a statement wasn't immediately available.

CVE-2018-0171,2025-02-20,bleeping computer,"The Chinese state-sponsored Salt Typhoon hacking group uses a custom utility called JumbledPath to stealthily monitor network traffic and potentially capture sensitive data in cyberattacks on U.S. telecommunication providers. Salt Typhoon (aka Earth Estries, GhostEmperor, and UNC2286) is a sophisticated hacking group active since at least 2019, primarily focusing on breaching government entities and telecommunications companies. Recently, the U.S. authorities have confirmed that Salt Typhoon was behind several successful breaches oftelecommunication service providersin the U.S., including Verizon, AT&T, and Lumen Technologies. It was later revealed that Salt Typhoon managed totap into the private communicationsof some U.S. government officials and stole information related to court-authorized wiretapping requests. Last week, the Recorded Future's Insikt Group reported that Salt Typhoontargeted over 1,000 Cisco network devices, more than half from the U.S., South America, and India, between December 2024 and January 2025, Today, Cisco Talos revealed more details about the threat actor's activity when they breached major telecommunications companies in the U.S., which in some cases spanned over three years. Cisco says Salt Typhoon hackers infiltrated core networking infrastructure primarily through stolen credentials. Apart from a single case involving exploitation of the CiscoCVE-2018-0171flaw, the cybersecurity company has seen no other flaws, known or zero-days, being exploited in this campaign. ""No new Cisco vulnerabilities were discovered during this campaign,""states Cisco Talos in its report. ""While there have been some reports that Salt Typhoon is abusing three other known Cisco vulnerabilities, we have not identified any evidence to confirm these claims."" While Salt Typhoon primarily gained access to targeted networks using stolen credentials, the exact method of obtaining the credentials remains unclear. Once inside, they expanded their access by extracting additional credentials from network device configurations and intercepting authentication traffic (SNMP, TACACS, and RADIUS). They also exfiltrated device configurations over TFTP and FTP to facilitate lateral movement, which contained sensitive authentication data, weakly encrypted passwords, and network mapping details. The attackers demonstrated advanced techniques for persistent access and evasion, including frequently pivoting between different networking devices to hide their traces and using compromised edge devices to pivot into partner telecom networks. The threat actors were also observed modifying network configurations, enabling Guest Shell access to execute commands, altering access control lists (ACLs), and creating hidden accounts. A primary component of the Salt Typhoon attacks was monitoring network activity and stealing data using packet-capturing tools like Tcpdump, Tpacap, Embedded Packet Capture, and a custom tool called JumbledPath. JumpedPath is a Go-based ELF binary built for x86_64 Linux-based systems that allowed it to run on a variety of edge networking devices from different manufacturers, including Cisco Nexus devices. JumbledPath allowed Salt Typhoon to initiate packet capture on a targeted Cisco device via a jump-host, an intermediary system that made the capture requests appear as if they originate from a trusted device inside the network while also obfuscating the attacker's true location. The same tool could also disable logging and clear existing logs to erase traces of its activity and make forensic investigations more difficult. Cisco lists several recommendations to detect Salt Typhoon activity, such as monitoring for unauthorized SSH activity on non-standard ports, tracking log anomalies, including missing or unusually large '.bash_history' files, and inspecting for unexpected configuration changes. Over the past couple of years, Chinese threat actors have increasingly targeted edge networking devices to install custom malware that allows them to monitor network communications, steal credentials, or act as proxy servers for relayed attacks. These attacks have targeted well-known manufacturers, includingFortinet,Barracuda,SonicWall, Check Point, D-Link, Cisco, Juniper, NetGear, and Sophos. While many of these attacks exploited zero-day vulnerabilities, other devices were breached through compromised credentials or older vulnerabilities. Therefore, admins must apply patches to edge networking devices as soon as they are available.

CVE-2024-24919,2025-02-20,bleeping computer,"A previously undocumented ransomware payload named NailaoLocker has been spotted in attacks targeting European healthcare organizations between June and October 2024. The attacks exploitedCVE-2024-24919, a Check Point Security Gateway vulnerability, to gain access to targeted networks and deploy the ShadowPad and PlugX malware, two families tightly associated with Chinese state-sponsored threat groups. Orange Cyberdefense CERT links the attacks to Chinese cyber-espionage tactics, though there's not enough evidence to attribute them to specific groups. Orange's researchersreportthat NailaoLocker is a relatively unsophisticated ransomware strain compared to the most prominent families in the space. The reason why Orange sees NailaoLocker as a rather basic ransomware is that, it does not terminate security processes or running services, it lacks anti-debugging and sandbox evasion mechanisms, and does not scan network shares. ""Written in C++, NailaoLocker is relatively unsophisticated and poorly designed, seemingly not intended to guarantee full encryption,"" mentions Orange. The malware is deployed on target systems via DLL sideloading (sensapi.dll) involving a legitimate and signed executable (usysdiag.exe). The malware loader (NailaoLoader) verifies the environment by performing memory address checks and then decrypts the main payload (usysdiag.exe.dat) and loads it into memory. Next, the NailaoLocker activates and begins encrypting files using an AES-256-CTR scheme, appending the "".locked"" extension to encrypted files. After the encryption is done, the ransomware drops an HTML ransom note with the very unusually long filename of ""unlock_please_view_this_file_unlock_please_view_this_file_unlock_please_view_this_file_unlock_please_view_this_file_unlock_please_view_this_file_unlock_please_view_this_file_unlock_please.html."" This ransom note instructs the victims to contact them at a disposable ProtonMail address, which, in a few cases seen by BleepingComputer, was johncollinsy@proton[.]me. The ransom note does not indicate that data was stolen, which is odd for most modern ransomware operations. Investigating deeper, Orange says they found some overlap between the content of the ransom note and a ransomware tool sold by a cybercrime group named Kodex Softwares (formerlyEvil Extractor). However, there were no direct code overlaps, making the connection blurry. Orange has shared several hypotheses for the attacks, including false flag operations meant to distract, strategic data theft operations doubled with revenue generation, and, more likely, a Chinese cyberespionage group ""moonlighting"" on the side to earn some money. Only last week,Symantec reportedabout suspected Emperor Dragonfly (a.k.a. Bronze Starlight) operatives deploying RA World ransomware against Asian software firms and demanding a ransom of $2 million. Compared to North Korean actors who are known to pursue multiple goals in parallel, including financial gains via ransomware attacks, Chinese state-backed actors haven't followed this approach, so the shift in tactics is concerning.

CVE-2018-13379,2025-02-19,bleeping computer,"CISA and the FBI said attackers deploying Ghost ransomware have breached victims from multiple industry sectors across over 70 countries, including critical infrastructure organizations. Other industries impacted include healthcare, government, education, technology, manufacturing, and numerous small and medium-sized businesses. ""Beginning early 2021, Ghost actors began attacking victims whose internet facing services ran outdated versions of software and firmware,"" CISA, the FBI, and the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC)said in a joint advisoryreleased on Wednesday. ""This indiscriminate targeting of networks containing vulnerabilities has led to the compromise of organizations across more than 70 countries, including organizations in China."" Ghost ransomware operators frequently rotate their malware executables, change the file extensions of encrypted files, alter the contents of their ransom notes, and utilize multiple email addresses for ransom communications, which has often led to fluctuating attribution of the group over time. Names linked to this group include Ghost, Cring, Crypt3r, Phantom, Strike, Hello, Wickrme, HsHarada, and Rapture, with ransomware samples used in their attacks including Cring.exe, Ghost.exe, ElysiumO.exe, and Locker.exe. This financially motivated ransomware group leverages publicly accessible code to exploit security flaws in vulnerable servers. They target vulnerabilities left unpatched in Fortinet (CVE-2018-13379), ColdFusion (CVE-2010-2861,CVE-2009-3960), and Exchange (CVE-2021-34473,CVE-2021-34523,CVE-2021-31207).

The vendor first disclosed the authentication bypass vulnerability tracked as CVE-2025-0108 on February 12, 2025, releasing patches to fix the vulnerability. That same day, Assetnote researcherspublished a proof-of-concept exploitdemonstrating how CVE-2025-0108 and CVE-2024-9474 could be chained together to gain root privileges on unpatched PAN-OS firewalls. A day later, network threat intel firm GreyNoise reported that threat actors hadbegun actively exploiting the flaws, with attempts coming from two IP addresses. CVE-2024-9474 is a privilege escalation flaw in PAN-OS fixed in November 2024 that allows a PAN-OS administrator to execute commands on firewalls with root privileges. Palo Alto Networks warned at the disclosure that the vulnerability wasexploited as a zero-day. CVE-2025-0111 is a file read vulnerability in PAN-OS, allowing authenticated attackers with network access to the management web interface to read files that are readable by the ""nobody"" user. The CVE-2025-0111 flaw was alsofixed on February 12, 2025, but the vendor updated its bulletin today to warn that it is also now being used in an exploit chain with the other two vulnerabilities in active attacks. ""Palo Alto Networks has observed exploit attempts chaining CVE-2025-0108 with CVE-2024-9474 and CVE-2025-0111 on unpatched and unsecured PAN-OS web management interfaces,""reads the updated bulletin.

CVE-2025-26466,2025-02-18,bleeping computer,"OpenSSH has released security updates addressing two vulnerabilities, a man-in-the-middle (MitM) and a denial of service flaw, with one of the flaws introduced over a decade ago. Qualys discovered both vulnerabilities and demonstrated their exploitability to OpenSSH's maintainers. OpenSSH (Open Secure Shell) is a free, open-source implementation of the SSH (Secure Shell) protocol, which provides encrypted communication for secure remote access, file transfers, and tunneling over untrusted networks. It is one of the most widely used tools in the world, with high levels of adoption across Linux and Unix-based (BSD, macOS) systems found in enterprise environments, IT, DevOps, cloud computing, and cybersecurity applications. The MiTM vulnerability, tracked under CVE-2025-26465, was introduced in December 2014 with the release of OpenSSH 6.8p1, so the issue remained undetected for over a decade. The flaw affects OpenSSH clients when the 'VerifyHostKeyDNS' option is enabled, allowing threat actors to perform MitM attacks. ""The attack against the OpenSSH client (CVE-2025-26465) succeeds regardless of whether the VerifyHostKeyDNS option is set to ""yes"" or ""ask"" (its default is ""no""), requires no user interaction, and does not depend on the existence of an SSHFP resource record (an SSH fingerprint) in DNS,""explains Qualys. When enabled, due to improper error handling, an attacker can trick the client into accepting a rogue server's key by forcing an out-of-memory error during verification. By intercepting an SSH connection and presenting a large SSH key with excessive certificate extensions, the attacker can exhaust the client's memory, bypass host verification, and hijack the session to steal credentials, inject commands, and exfiltrate data. Although the 'VerifyHostKeyDNS' option is disabled by default in OpenSSH, it was enabled by default on FreeBSD from 2013 until 2023, leaving many systems exposed to these attacks. The second vulnerability is CVE-2025-26466, a pre-authentication denial of service flaw introduced in OpenSSH 9.5p1, released in August 2023. The issue arises from an unrestricted memory allocation during the key exchange, leading to uncontrolled resource consumption. An attacker can repeatedly send small 16-byte ping messages, which forces OpenSSH to buffer 256-byte responses without immediate limits. During the key exchange, these responses are stored indefinitely, leading to excessive memory consumption and CPU overload, potentially causing system crashes. The repercussions of exploitation of CVE-2025-26466 may not be as severe as the first flaw, but the fact that it's exploitable before authentication maintains a very high risk for disruption. The OpenSSH team publishedversion 9.9p2earlier today, which addresses both vulnerabilities, so everyone is recommended to move to that release as soon as possible. Additionally, it is recommended to disable VerifyHostKeyDNS unless absolutely necessary and rely on manual key fingerprint verification to ensure secure SSH connections. Regarding the DoS problem, administrators are encouraged to enforce strict connection rate limits and monitor SSH traffic for abnormal patterns to stop potential attacks early.

CVE-2025-0108,2025-02-14,bleeping computer,"Hackers are launching attacks against Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS firewalls by exploiting a recently fixed vulnerability (CVE-2025-0108) that allows bypassing authentication. The security issue received a high-severity score and impacts the PAN-OS management web interface and allows an unauthenticated attacker on the network to bypass authentication and invoke certain PHP scripts, potentially compromising integrity and confidentiality. In asecurity bulletinon February 12, Palo Alto Networks urges admins to upgrade firewalls to the versions below to address the issue: PAN-OS 11.0 is also impacted but the product reached the end of life (EoL) and Palo Alto Networks does not plan to release any fixes for it. Because of this, users are strongly recommended to upgrade to a supported release instead. The vulnerability was discovered and reported to Palo Alto Networks by security researchers at Assetnote. They also published a write-up withcomplete exploitation detailswhen the patch was released. The researchers demonstrated how the flaw could be leveraged to extract sensitive system data, retrieve firewall configurations, or potentially manipulate certain settings within PAN-OS. The exploit leverages a path confusion between Nginx and Apache in PAN-OS that allows bypassing authentication. Attackers with network access to the management interface can leverage this to gather intelligence for further attacks or to weaken security defenses by modifying accessible settings.

CVE-2024-53704,2025-02-14,bleeping computer,"Attackers are now targeting an authentication bypass vulnerability affecting SonicWall firewalls shortly after the release of proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit code. This security flaw (CVE-2024-53704), tagged by CISA as critical severity and found in the SSLVPN authentication mechanism, impacts SonicOS versions 7.1.x (up to 7.1.1-7058), 7.1.2-7019, and 8.0.0-8035, used by multiple models of Gen 6 and Gen 7 firewalls and SOHO series devices. Successful exploitation enables remote attackers to hijack active SSL VPN sessions without authentication, which grants them unauthorized access to targets' networks. SonicWallurged customers to immediately upgradetheir firewalls' SonicOS firmware to prevent exploitation in an email sent before disclosing the vulnerability publicly andreleasing security updateson January 7. The company also shared mitigation measures for admins who couldn't immediately secure their devices, including limiting access to trusted sources and restricting access from the Internet entirely if not needed. On Thursday, cybersecurity company Arctic Wolf said they started detecting exploitation attempts targeting this vulnerability in attacks ""shortly after the PoC was made public,"" confirming SonicWall's fears regarding the vulnerability's increased exploitation potential. ""The released PoC exploit allows an unauthenticated threat actor to bypass MFA, disclose private information, and interrupt running VPN sessions,""Arctic Wolf stated. ""Given the ease of exploitation and available threat intelligence, Arctic Wolf strongly recommends upgrading to a fixed firmware to address this vulnerability."" Security researchers at Bishop Fox published aPoC exploiton February 10, roughly one month after patches were released. Bishop Fox added that roughly 4,500 unpatched SonicWall SSL VPN servers were exposed online according to internet scans on February 7. ""Proof-of-Concepts (PoCs) for the SonicOS SSLVPN Authentication Bypass Vulnerability (CVE-2024-53704) are now publicly available,""SonicWall warnedafter the exploit code was released. ""This significantly increases the risk of exploitation. Customers must immediately update all unpatched firewalls (7.1.x & 8.0.0). If applying the firmware update is not possible, disable SSLVPN.""

Rapid7 security researchers have also identified a method to exploit CVE-2025-1094 for remote code execution in vulnerable BeyondTrust Remote Support (RS) systems independently of the CVE-2024-12356 argument injection vulnerability. More importantly, they've found that while BeyondTrust's patch for CVE-2024-12356 does not address CVE-2025-1094's root cause, it successfully prevents the exploitation of both vulnerabilities. ""We have also learnt that it is possible to exploit CVE-2025-1094 in BeyondTrust Remote Support without the need to leverage CVE-2024-12356,""Rapid7 said. ""However, due to some additional input sanitation that the patch for CVE-2024-12356 employs, exploitation will still fail.""

CVE-2023-20198,2025-02-14,bleeping computer,"China's Salt Typhoon hackers are still actively targeting telecoms worldwide and have breached more U.S. telecommunications providers via unpatched Cisco IOS XE network devices. Recorded Future's Insikt Group threat research division states that the Chinese hacking group (tracked Salt Typhoon and RedMike) has exploited theCVE-2023-20198privilege escalation andCVE-2023-20273Web UI command injection vulnerabilities. These ongoing attacks have already resulted in network breaches at multiple telecommunications providers, including a U.S. internet service provider (ISP), a U.S.-based affiliate of a U.K. telecommunications provider, a South African telecom provider, an Italian ISP, and a large Thailand telecommunications provider. The threat researchers said they've spotted compromised and reconfigured Cisco devices on their networks, communicating with Salt Typhoon-controlled servers via generic routing encapsulation (GRE) tunnels for persistent access. Between December 2024 and January 2025, Salt Typhoon targeted over 1,000 Cisco network devices, more than half from the U.S., South America, and India.

CVE-2024-0012,2025-02-13,bleeping computer,"A China-based threat actor, tracked as Emperor Dragonfly and commonly associated with cybercriminal endeavors, has been observed using in a ransomware attack a toolset previously attributed to espionage actors. The hackers deployed the RA World ransomware against an Asian software and services company and demanded an initial ransom payment of $2 million. Researchers from Symantec’s Threat Hunter Team observed the activity in late 2024 and highlight a potential overlap between state-backed cyber espionage actors and financially motivated cybercrime groups. “During the attack in late 2024, the attacker deployed a distinct toolset that had previously been used by a China-linked actor in classic espionage attacks,” the researcherssay, adding that ""tools associated with China-based espionage groups are often shared resources"" but ""many aren’t publicly available and aren’t usually associated with cybercrime activity.” A report inJuly 2024from Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42 also associated  Emperor Dragonfly (a.k.a. Bronze Starlight) with RA World, albeit with low confidence. According to the researchers, the RA World spun fromRA Group, which launched in 2023 as a Babuk-based family. Between July 2024 to January 2025, the China-based espionaged actor targeted government ministries and telecom operators in Southeast Europe and Asia, the apparent goal being long-term persistence. In these attacks, a specific variant of the PlugX (Korplug) backdoor was deployed with a Toshiba executable (toshdpdb.exe) via DLL sideloading, along with a malicious DLL (toshdpapi.dll). Moreover, Symantec observed the use of NPS proxy, a China-developed tool used for covert network communication, and various RC4-encrypted payloads. In November 2024, the same Korplug payload was used against a South Asian software company. This time, it was followed by an RA World ransomware attack. The attacker allegedly exploited Palo Alto PAN-OS (CVE-2024-0012) to infiltrate the network and then followed the same sideloading technique involving the Toshiba executable and DLL file to deploy Korplug before encrypting the machines. Based on the available evidence, the hypothesis is that the Chinese state-backed cyber operatives carrying out espionage attacks may “moonlight” as ransomware actors for personal profit.

CVE-2025-21391,2025-02-11,bleeping computer,"Today is Microsoft's February 2025 Patch Tuesday, which includes security updates for 55 flaws, including four zero-day vulnerabilities, with two actively exploited in attacks. This Patch Tuesday also fixes three ""Critical"" vulnerabilities, all remote code execution vulnerabilities. The number of bugs in each vulnerability category is listed below: The above numbers do not include a critical Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales elevation of privileges flaw and 10 Microsoft Edge vulnerabilities fixed on February 6. To learn more about the non-security updates released today, you can review our dedicated articles on theWindows 11 KB5051987 & KB5051989 cumulative updatesand theWindows 10 KB5051974 update. This month's Patch Tuesday fixes two actively exploited and two publicly exposed zero-day vulnerabilities. Microsoft classifies a zero-day flaw as one that is publicly disclosed or actively exploited while no official fix is available. The actively exploited zero-day vulnerability in today's updates are: CVE-2025-21391- Windows Storage Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability Microsoft has fixed an actively exploited elevation of privileges vulnerability that can be used to delete files. ""An attacker would only be able to delete targeted files on a system,"" reads Microsoft's advisory. ""This vulnerability does not allow disclosure of any confidential information, but could allow an attacker to delete data that could include data that results in the service being unavailable,"" continued Microsoft. No information has been released about how this flaw was exploited in attacks and who disclosed it. CVE-2025-21418- Windows Ancillary Function Driver for WinSock Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability The second actively exploited vulnerability allows threat actors to gain SYSTEM privileges in Windows. It is unknown how it was used in attacks, and Microsoft says this flaw was disclosed anonymously. The publicly disclosed zero-days are: CVE-2025-21194- Microsoft Surface Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability Microsoft says that this flaw is a hypervisor vulnerability that allows attacks to bypass UEFI and compromise the secure kernel. ""This Hypervisor vulnerability relates to Virtual Machines within a Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) host machine,"" explains Microsoft's advisory. ""On some specific hardware it might be possible to bypass the UEFI, which could lead to the compromise of the hypervisor and the secure kernel."" Microsoft says that Francisco Falcón and Iván Arce of Quarkslab discovered the vulnerability. While Microsoft did not share many details about the flaw, it is likely connected to thePixieFail flawsdisclosed by the researchers last month. PixieFail is a set of nine vulnerabilities that impact the IPv6 network protocol stack of Tianocore's EDK II, which is used by Microsoft Surface and the company's hypervisor products. CVE-2025-21377- NTLM Hash Disclosure Spoofing Vulnerability Microsoft fixed a publicly disclosed bug that exposes a Window user's NTLM hashes, allowing a remote attacker to potentially log in as the user. ""Minimal interaction with a malicious file by a user such as selecting (single-click), inspecting (right-click), or performing an action other than opening or executing the file could trigger this vulnerability."" explains Microsoft's advisory. While Microsoft has not shared many details about the flaw, it likely acts like other NTLM hash disclosure flaws, where simply interacting with a file rather than opening it could cause Windows to remotely connect to a remote share. When doing so, an NTLM negotiation passes the user's NTLM hash to the remote server, which the attacker can collect. These NTLM hashes can then be cracked to get the plain-text password or used inpass-the-hash attacks. Microsoft says this flaw was discovered by Owen Cheung, Ivan Sheung, and Vincent Yau with Cathay Pacific, Yorick Koster of Securify B.V., and Blaz Satler with 0patch by ACROS Security.

""On some specific hardware it might be possible to bypass the UEFI, which could lead to the compromise of the hypervisor and the secure kernel."" Microsoft says that Francisco Falcón and Iván Arce of Quarkslab discovered the vulnerability. While Microsoft did not share many details about the flaw, it is likely connected to thePixieFail flawsdisclosed by the researchers last month. PixieFail is a set of nine vulnerabilities that impact the IPv6 network protocol stack of Tianocore's EDK II, which is used by Microsoft Surface and the company's hypervisor products. CVE-2025-21377- NTLM Hash Disclosure Spoofing Vulnerability Microsoft fixed a publicly disclosed bug that exposes a Window user's NTLM hashes, allowing a remote attacker to potentially log in as the user. ""Minimal interaction with a malicious file by a user such as selecting (single-click), inspecting (right-click), or performing an action other than opening or executing the file could trigger this vulnerability."" explains Microsoft's advisory. While Microsoft has not shared many details about the flaw, it likely acts like other NTLM hash disclosure flaws, where simply interacting with a file rather than opening it could cause Windows to remotely connect to a remote share. When doing so, an NTLM negotiation passes the user's NTLM hash to the remote server, which the attacker can collect. These NTLM hashes can then be cracked to get the plain-text password or used inpass-the-hash attacks. Microsoft says this flaw was discovered by Owen Cheung, Ivan Sheung, and Vincent Yau with Cathay Pacific, Yorick Koster of Securify B.V., and Blaz Satler with 0patch by ACROS Security.

Furthermore, even thoughtoday's updated advisoryindicates that both flaws were exploited in attacks and even includes a workaround for the new CSF proxy requests exploitation pathway, Fortinet says that only CVE-2024-55591 was exploited. Fortinet told BleepingComputer that if a customer previously upgraded based on the guidance in FG-IR-24-535 / CVE-2024-55591, then they are already protected against the newly disclosed vulnerability. The title of our story has been updated to reflect this new information, and our original article is below. Fortinet warned today that attackers are exploiting another now-patched zero-day bug in FortiOS and FortiProxy to hijack Fortinet firewalls and breach enterprise networks. Successful exploitation of this authentication bypass vulnerability (CVE-2025-24472) allows remote attackers to gain super-admin privileges by making maliciously crafted CSF proxy requests. The security flaw impacts FortiOS 7.0.0 through 7.0.16, FortiProxy 7.0.0 through 7.0.19, and FortiProxy 7.2.0 through 7.2.12. Fortinet fixed it in FortiOS 7.0.17 or above and FortiProxy 7.0.20/7.2.13 or above. Fortinet added the bug as a new CVE-ID to asecurity advisory issued last monthcautioning customers thatthreat actorswere exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in FortiOS and FortiProxy (tracked asCVE-2024-55591), which affected the same software versions. However, the now-fixed CVE-2024-55591 flaw could be exploited by sending malicious requests to the Node.js websocket module. According to Fortinet, attackers exploit the two vulnerabilities to generate random admin or local users on affected devices, adding them to new and existing SSL VPN user groups. They have also been seen modifying firewall policies and other configurations and accessing SSLVPN instances with previously established rogue accounts ""to gain a tunnel to the internal network.network."" While Fortinet didn't provide additional information on the campaign, cybersecurity company Arctic Wolfreleased a reportwith matching indicators of compromise (IOCs), saying vulnerable Fortinet FortiGate firewalls with Internet-exposed management interfaces have been under attack since at least mid-November. ""The campaign involved unauthorized administrative logins on management interfaces of firewalls, creation of new accounts, SSL VPN authentication through those accounts, and various other configuration changes,"" Arctic Wolf Labs said. ""While the initial access vector is not definitively confirmed, a zero-day vulnerability is highly probable. Organizations should urgently disable firewall management access on public interfaces as soon as possible."" Arctic Wolf Labs also provided this timeline for CVE-2024-55591 mass-exploitation attacks, saying it includes four unique phases: ""Given subtle differences in tradecraft and infrastructure between intrusions, it is possible that multiple individuals or groups may have been involved in this campaign, but jsconsole usage was a common thread across the board,"" it added. Arctic Wolf Labs added that it notified Fortinet about the attacks on December 12 and received confirmation from the company's Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) five days later that the activity was known and already under investigation. Fortinet advised admins who can't immediately deploy the security updates to secure vulnerable firewalls to disable the HTTP/HTTPS administrative interface or limit the IP addresses that can reach it via local-in policies as a workaround.

CVE-2024-53704,2025-02-11,bleeping computer,"Security researchers at Bishop Fox have published complete exploitation details for the CVE-2024-53704 vulnerability that allows bypassing the authentication mechanism in certain versions of the SonicOS SSLVPN application. The vendor warned about the high exploitation possibility of the flaw in a bulletin on January 7, urging administrators to upgrade their SonicOS firewalls' firmware to address the problem. ""We have identified a firewall vulnerability that is susceptible to actual exploitation for customers with SSL VPN or SSH management enabled, and that should be mitigated immediately by upgrading to the latest firmware,""warned SonicWallin an email sent to customers at the time. The flaw allows a remote attacker to hijack active SSL VPN sessions without authentication, granting them unauthorized access to the victim's network. On January 22  Bishop Fox researchersannouncedthat they had developed an exploit for CVE-2024-53704 after a ""significant reverse-engineering effort,"" confirming SonicWall's fears about the exploitation potential of the vulnerability. After allowing some time for system administrators to apply the available patches, Bishop Foxreleased the full exploitation detailson Monday. The exploit works by sending a specially crafted session cookie containing a base64-encoded string of null bytes to the SSL VPN authentication endpoint at '/cgi-bin/sslvpnclient.' This triggers an incorrect validation of the session, as the mechanism assumes that the request is associated with an active VPN session. This logs out the victim and gives the attacker access to the session, allowing them to read the user's Virtual Office bookmarks, obtain VPN client configuration settings, open a VPN tunnel to the internal network, and provides access to private network resources. The researchers put the validity of their analysis to the test and created a proof-of-concept exploit code to simulate an authentication bypass attack. The response headers showed that they had successfully hijacked an active session. ""With that, we were able to identify the username and domain of the hijacked session, along with private routes the user was able to access through the SSL VPN,"" the researchers said. The issue impacts SonicOS versions 7.1.x (up to 7.1.1-7058), 7.1.2-7019, and 8.0.0-8035. These versions run in multiple models of Gen 6 and Gen 7 firewalls, as well as SOHO series devices. Fixes were made available in SonicOS 8.0.0-8037 and later, 7.0.1-5165 and higher, 7.1.3-7015 and higher, and 6.5.5.1-6n and higher. For model-specific information, check outSonicWall's bulletin here. Bishop Fox says that internet scans as of February 7 show roughly 4,500 internet-exposed SonicWall SSL VPN servers without the security updates fixing CVE-2024-53704. With a working proof-of-concept exploit now publicly available, admins should apply the updates as soon as possible because the exploitation risk for CVE-2024-53704 has increased significantly.

CVE-2024-52875,2025-02-10,bleeping computer,"Over twelve thousand GFI KerioControl firewall instances are exposed to a critical remote code execution vulnerability tracked as CVE-2024-52875. KerioControl is a network security suite that small and medium-sized businesses use for VPNs, bandwidth management, reporting and monitoring, traffic filtering, AV protection, and intrusion prevention. The flaw in question was discovered in mid-December by security researcher Egidio Romano (EgiX), who demonstrated the potential for dangerous 1-click RCE attacks. GFI Software released a security update for the problem with version 9.4.5 Patch 1 on December 19, 2024, yet three weeks later,according to Censys, over 23,800 instances remained vulnerable. Early last month, Greynoise revealed it haddetected active exploitationattempts leveraging Romano's proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit, aimed at stealing admin CSRF tokens. Despite the warning about active exploitation, threat monitoring service The Shadowserver Foundationnow reportsseeing 12,229 KerioControl firewalls exposed to attacks leveraging CVE-2024-52875. Most of these instances are located in Iran, the United States, Italy, Germany, Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, France, Brazil, and India.

""User input passed to these pages via the ""dest"" GET parameter is not properly sanitized before being used to generate a ""Location"" HTTP header in a 302 HTTP response,"" explainsEgidio Romano. ""Specifically, the application does not correctly filter/remove linefeed (LF) characters. This can be exploited to perform HTTP Response Splitting attacks, which in turn might allow to carry out Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and possibly other attacks."" ""NOTE: the Reflected XSS vector might be abused to perform 1-click Remote Code Execution (RCE) attacks.""

CVE-2025-0994,2025-02-07,bleeping computer,"Software vendor Trimble is warning that hackers are exploiting a Cityworks deserialization vulnerability to remotely execute commands on IIS servers and deploy Cobalt Strike beacons for initial network access. Trimble Cityworks is a Geographic Information System (GIS)-centric asset management and work order management software designed primarily for local governments, utilities, and public works organizations. The product helps municipalities and infrastructure agencies manage public assets, process work orders, handle permitting and licensing, capital planning, and budgeting, among other things. The flaw, tracked asCVE-2025-0994, is a high severity (CVSS v4.0 score: 8.6) deserialization problem that allows authenticated users to perform RCE attacks against a customer's Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) servers. Trimblestatesthat it has investigated customer reports about hackers gaining unauthorized access to customer networks by leveraging the flaw, indicating that exploitation is underway. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) hasreleased a coordinated advisorywarning customers to immediately secure their networks from attacks. The CVE-2025-0994 flaw impacts Cityworks versions prior to 15.8.9 and Cityworks with office companion versions before 23.10. The latest versions, 15.8.9 and 23.10, were made available on January 28 and 29, 2025, respectively. Administrators managing on-premise deployments must apply the security update as soon as possible, while cloud-hosted instances (CWOL) will receive the updates automatically. Trimble says it has discovered that some on-premises deployments may have overprivileged IIS identity permissions, warning that these should not run with local or domain-level administrative privileges. Moreover, some deployments have incorrect attachment directory configurations. The vendor recommends restricting attachment root folders to contain only attachments. After completing all three actions, customers may resume normal operations with Cityworks. While CISA has not shared how the flaw is being exploited, Trimble has releasedindicators of compromisefor attacks seen exploiting the vulnerability. These IOCs indicate that the threat actors deployed a variety of tools for remote access, including WinPutty and Cobalt Strike beacons.

CVE-2024-21413,2025-02-06,bleeping computer,"CISA warned U.S. federal agencies on Thursday to secure their systems against ongoing attacks targeting a critical Microsoft Outlook remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability. Discovered by Check Point vulnerability researcher Haifei Li and tracked asCVE-2024-21413, the flaw is caused by improper input validation when opening emails with malicious links using vulnerable Outlook versions. The attackers gain remote code execution capabilities because the flaw lets them bypass the Protected View (which should block harmful content embedded in Office files by opening them in read-only mode) and open malicious Office files in editing mode. When it patched CVE-2024-21413 one year ago, Microsoft also warned that the Preview Pane is an attack vector, allowing successful exploitation even when previewing maliciously crafted Office documents. AsCheck Point explained, this security flaw (dubbed Moniker Link) lets threat actors bypass built-in Outlook protections for malicious links embedded in emails using the file:// protocol and by adding an exclamation mark to URLs pointing to attacker-controlled servers. The exclamation mark is added right after the file extension, together with random text (in their example, Check Point used ""something""), as shown below: CVE-2024-21413 affects multiple Office products, including Microsoft Office LTSC 2021, Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise, Microsoft Outlook 2016, and Microsoft Office 2019, and successful CVE-2024-21413 attacks can result in the theft of NTLM credentials and the execution of arbitrary code via maliciously crafted Office documents. On Thursday, CISAaddedthe vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, marking it as actively exploited.

CVE-2024-57726,2025-02-06,bleeping computer,"Hackers are targeting vulnerable SimpleHelp RMM clients to create administrator accounts, drop backdoors, and potentially lay the groundwork for ransomware attacks. The flaws are tracked as CVE-2024-57726, CVE-2024-57727, and CVE-2024-57728 and were reported as potentially actively exploited byArctic Wolflast week. However, the cybersecurity firm could not confirm for sure if the flaws were used. Cybersecurity firm Field Effect has confirmed to BleepingComputer that the flaws are being exploited in recent attacks and releaseda reportthat sheds light on the post-exploitation activity. Additionally, the cybersecurity researchers mention that the observed activity has signs of Akira ransomware attacks, though they do not hold enough evidence to make a high-confidence attribution. The attack started with the threat actors exploiting the vulnerabilities in the SimpleHelp RMM client to establish an unauthorized connection to a target endpoint. The attackers connected from the IP 194.76.227[.]171, an Estonian-based server running a SimpleHelp instance on port 80. Once connected via RMM, the attackers quickly executed a series of discovery commands to learn more about the target environment, including system and network details, users and privileges, scheduled tasks and services, and domain controller information. Field Effect also observed a command that searched for the CrowdStrike Falcon security suite, likely a bypass attempt bypass. Leveraging their access and knowledge, the attackers then proceeded to create a new administrator account named ""sqladmin"" to maintain access to the environment, followed by the installation of the Sliver post-exploitation framework (agent.exe). Sliver is a post-exploitation framework developed by BishopFox that has seenincreased usage over the past couple of yearsas an alternative to Cobalt Strike, which is increasingly detected by endpoint protection. When deployed, Sliver will connect back to a command and control server (C2) to open a reverse shell or wait for commands to execute on the infected host. The Sliver beacon observed in the attack was configured to connect to a C2 in the Netherlands. Field Effect also identified a backup IP with Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) enabled. With persistence established, the attackers moved deeper into the network by compromising the Domain Controller (DC) using the same SimpleHelp RMM client and creating another admin account (""fpmhlttech""). Instead of the backdoor, the attackers installed a Cloudflare Tunnel disguised as Windows svchost.exe to maintain stealthy access and bypass security controls and firewalls. SimpleHelp users are advised to apply the available security updates that address CVE-2024-57726, CVE-2024-57727, and CVE-2024-57728 as soon as possible. For more info,check the vendor's bulletin. Additionally, look for administrator accounts named 'sqladmin' and 'fpmhlttech,' or any others you don't recognize, and look for connections to the IPs listed in Field Effect's report. Ultimately, users should restrict SimpleHelp access to trusted IP ranges to prevent unauthorized access.

CVE-2025-20169,2025-02-06,bleeping computer,"Cisco has released patches to fix two critical vulnerabilities in its Identity Services Engine (ISE) security policy management platform. Enterprise administrators use Cisco ISE as an identity and access management (IAM) solution that combines authentication, authorization, and accounting into a single appliance. The two security flaws (CVE-2025-20124 and CVE-2025-20125) can be exploited by authenticated remote attackers with read-only admin privileges to execute arbitrary commands as root and bypass authorization on unpatched devices. These vulnerabilities impact Cisco ISE and Cisco ISE Passive Identity Connector (ISE-PIC) appliances, regardless of device configuration. ""This vulnerability is due to insecure deserialization of user-supplied Java byte streams by the affected software,""Cisco said, describing the CVE-2025-20124 bug tagged with a 9.9/10 severity rating. ""An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted serialized Java object to an affected API.

CVE-2023-24932,2025-02-05,bleeping computer,"Microsoft has released a PowerShell script to help Windows users and admins update bootable media so it utilizes the new ""Windows UEFI CA 2023"" certificate before the mitigations of the BlackLotus UEFI bootkit are enforced later this year. BlackLotus is a UEFI bootkit that can bypass Secure Boot and gain control over the operating system's boot process. Once in control,BlackLotus can disable Windows security features, such as BitLocker, Hypervisor-Protected Code Integrity (HVCI), and Microsoft Defender Antivirus, allowing it to deploy malware at the highest privilege level while remaining undetected. In March 2023 and then July 2024,Microsoft released security updatesfor a Secure Boot bypass tracked asCVE-2023-24932that revokes vulnerable boot managers used by BlackLotus. However, this fix is disabled by default, as incorrectly applying the update or conflicts on devices could cause the operating system to no longer load. Instead, rolling out the fix in stages allows Windows admins to test it before it is enforced sometime before 2026. When enabled, the security update will add the ""Windows UEFI CA 2023"" certificate to the UEFI ""Secure Boot Signature Database."" Admins can then install newer boot managers that are signed with this certificate. This process also includes updating the Secure Boot Forbidden Signature Database (DBX) to add the ""Windows Production CA 2011"" certificate. This certificate is used to sign older, vulnerable boot managers, and once revoked, will cause those boot managers to become untrusted and not load. However, if you apply the mitigations and run into an issue booting your devices, you must first update your bootable media to use the Windows UEFI CA 2023 certificate to troubleshoot the Windows install. ""If you encounter an issue with the device after applying the mitigations and the device becomes unbootable, you might be unable to start or recover your device from existing media,"" Microsoft explains in asupport bulletinabout the staged rollout of fixes for CVE-2023-24932. ""Recovery or install media will need to be updated so that it will work with a device that has the mitigations applied."" Yesterday, Microsoft released aPowerShell scriptthat helps you update bootable media so it uses the Windows UEFI CA 2023 certificate. ""The PowerShell script described in this article can be used to update Windows bootable media so that the media can be used on systems that trust the Windows UEFI CA 2023 certificate,"" explains a newsupport bulletinabout the script. The PowerShell script can bedownloaded from Microsoftand can be used to update bootable media files for ISO CD/DVD image files, a USB flash drive, a local drive path, or a network drive path. To utilize the utility, you must firstdownload and install the Windows ADK, which is necessary for this script to work correctly. When run, the script will update the media files to use the Windows UEFI CA 2023 certificate and install the boot managers signed by this certificate.

CVE-2024-53104,2025-02-05,bleeping computer,"​CISA has ordered federal agencies to secure their systems within three weeks against a high-severity Linux kernel flaw actively exploited in attacks. Tracked asCVE-2024-53104, the security bug was first introduced inkernel version 2.6.26and waspatched by Googlefor Android users on Monday. ""There are indications that CVE-2024-53104 may be under limited, targeted exploitation,"" the Android February 2025 Android security updates warn. According toGoogle's security advisory, this vulnerability is caused by anout-of-bounds write weaknessin theUSB Video Class (UVC) driver, which allows ""physical escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed"" on unpatched devices. The driver's inability to accurately parse UVC_VS_UNDEFINED frames within the uvc_parse_format function triggers the issue, leading to frame buffer size miscalculations and potential out-of-bounds writes. While Google didn't provide additional information on the zero-day attacks exploiting this vulnerability, the GrapheneOS development teamsaysthis USB peripheral driver vulnerability is ""likely one of the USB bugs exploited by forensic data extraction tools.""  ​As mandated by the November 2021 Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01, U.S. federal agencies must secure their networks against ongoing attacks targeting flawsaddedto CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog. The cybersecurity agency has given Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies three weeks to patch their Linux and Android devices by February 26. ""These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise,""CISA warned today. On Tuesday, CISA alsotagged high-severity and critical vulnerabilitiesin Microsoft .NET Framework and Apache OFBiz (Open For Business) software as actively exploited in the wild. However, it didn't provide details on who was behind the attacks. With Five Eyes cybersecurity agencies in the UK, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the U.S., it also sharedsecurity guidance for network edge devices, urging manufacturers to improve forensic visibility to help defenders detect attacks and investigate breaches.

CVE-2024-56161,2025-02-05,bleeping computer,"​AMD has released mitigation and firmware updates to address a high-severity vulnerability that can be exploited to load malicious CPU microcode on unpatched devices. The security flaw (CVE-2024-56161) is caused by an improper signature verification weakness in AMD's CPU ROM microcode patch loader. Attackers with local administrator privileges can exploit this weakness, resulting in the loss of confidentiality and integrity of a confidential guest running under AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization-Secure Nested Paging (SEV-SNP). According toAMD's development resources, SEV isolates guests and the hypervisor from one another, and SEV-SNP adds memory integrity protection that creates an isolated execution environment by helping prevent malicious hypervisor-based attacks (e.g., data replay, memory re-mapping, and more). AMD nowprovides mitigationrequiring a microcode update on all affected platforms to block malicious microcode execution. Some platforms also require a SEV firmware update for SEV-SNP attestation, with users having to update the system BIOS and reboot to enable attestation of the mitigation. To confirm that the mitigation has been correctly installed, check whether the microcode version(s) matches the one(s) listed in the table below. ""We have demonstrated the ability to craft arbitrary malicious microcode patches on Zen 1 through Zen 4 CPUs. The vulnerability is that the CPU uses an insecure hash function in the signature validation for microcode updates,"" theGoogle Security Team said. ""This vulnerability could be used by an adversary to compromise confidential computing workloads protected by the newest version of AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization, SEV-SNP or to compromise Dynamic Root of Trust Measurement."" Google security researchers, credited with finding and reporting this flaw to AMD, have also shared aproof-of-concept (PoC) exploit(tested on AMD EPYC and AMD Ryzen 9 CPUs) that shows how attackers can create arbitrary microcode patches. Their PoC exploit makes the RDRAND instruction on vulnerable AMD Zen processors always return 4, which also sets the carry flag (CF) to 0. This indicates that the return value is invalid and ensures the exploit can't be used ""to compromise correctly functioning confidential computing workloads."" This week, AMD has also received a report from Li-Chung Chiang at NTU (National Taiwan University) detailing cache-based side-channel attacks against Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) that impact data center (1st Gen to 4th Gen AMD EPYC) and embedded (AMD EPYC 3000/7002/7003/9004) processors. AMD advised developers to follow best practices for prime and probe attacks (e.g., constant-time algorithms), avoid secret-dependent data whenever possible, and follow theguidance regarding Spectre-type attacks.

CVE-2025-0411,2025-02-04,bleeping computer,"A 7-Zip vulnerability allowing attackers to bypass the Mark of the Web (MotW) Windows security feature was exploited by Russian hackers as a zero-day since September 2024. According to Trend Micro researchers, the flaw was used in SmokeLoader malware campaigns targeting the Ukrainian government and private organizations in the country. The Mark of the Web is a Windows security feature designed to warn users that the file they're about to execute comes from untrusted sources, requesting a confirmation step via an additional prompt. Bypassing MoTW allows malicious files to run on the victim's machine without a warning. When downloading documents and executables from the web or received as an email attachment, Windows adds a special 'Zone.Id' alternate data stream called theMark-of-the-Web(MoTW) to the file. When attempting to open a downloaded file, Windows will check if a MoTW exists and, if so, display additional warnings to the user, asking if they are sure they wish to run the file. Similarly, when opening a document in Word or Excel with a MoTW flag, Microsoft Office will generate additional warnings and turn off macros. As the Mark of the Web security features prevent dangerous files from automatically running, threat actorscommonlyattempt tofind MoTW bypassesso their files automatically run and execute. For years, cybersecurity researchersrequested 7-Zip add supportfor the Mark of the Web, but it was only in 2022 thatsupport for the feature was finally added. Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) team firstdiscovered the flaw, now tracked as CVE-2025-0411, on September 25, 2024, observing it in attacks carried out by Russian threat actors. Hackers leveraged CVE-2025-0411 using double archived files (an archive within an archive) to exploit a lack of inheritance of the MoTW flag, resulting in malicious file execution without triggering warnings. The specially crafted archive files were sent to targets via phishing emails from compromised Ukrainian government accounts to bypass security filters and appear legitimate. Utilizing homoglyph techniques, the attackers hid their payloads within the 7-Zip files, making them appear harmless Word or PDF documents. Although opening the parent archive does propagate the MoTW flag, the CVE-2025-0411 flaw caused the flag not to propagate to the contents of the inner archive, allowing malicious scripts and executables to launch directly. This last step triggers the SmokeLoader payload, a malware dropper used in the past to install info-stealers, trojans, ransomware, or creating backdoors for persistent access. Trend Micro says these attacks impacted the following organizations: Although the discovery of the zero-day came in September, it took Trend Micro until October 1, 2024, to share a working proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit with the developers of 7-Zip. The latter addressed the risks via apatch implemented in version 24.09, released on November 30, 2024. However, as 7-Zip does not include an auto-update feature, it is common for 7-Zip users to run outdated versions. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that users download the latest version to make sure they are protected from this vulnerability.

CVE-2024-43047,2025-02-03,bleeping computer,"The February 2025 Android security updates patch 48 vulnerabilities, including a zero-day kernel vulnerability that has been exploited in the wild. This high-severity zero-day (tracked asCVE-2024-53104) is a privilege escalation security flaw in the Android Kernel'sUSB Video Class driverthat allows authenticated local threat actors to elevate privileges in low-complexity attacks. The issue occurs because the driver does not accurately parse frames of the type UVC_VS_UNDEFINED within the uvc_parse_format function. As a result, the frame buffer size is miscalculated, leading to potential out-of-bounds writes that can be exploited in arbitrary code execution or denial-of-service attacks. In addition to this actively exploited zero-day bug, theFebruary 2025 Android security updatesalso fix a critical security flaw in Qualcomm's WLAN component. Qualcommdescribesthis critical flaw (CVE-2024-45569) as a firmware memory corruption issue caused by anImproper Validation of Array Indexweakness in WLAN host communication when parsing the ML IE due to invalid frame content. CVE-2024-45569 can be exploited by remote attackers to potentially execute arbitrary code or commands, read or modify memory, and trigger crashes in low-complexity attacks that don't require privileges or user interaction. Google released two sets of patches for February 2025, the2025-02-01and2025-02-05security patch levels. The latter includes all fixes from the first batch and additional patches for closed-source third-party and kernel elements, which may not apply to all Android devices.

CVE-2018-17532,2025-01-29,bleeping computer,"A new variant of the Mirai-based botnet malware Aquabot has been observed actively exploiting CVE-2024-41710, a command injection vulnerability in Mitel SIP phones. The activity was discovered by Akamai's Security Intelligence and Response Team (SIRT), who reports that this is the third variant of Aquabot that falls under their radar. The malware family was introduced in 2023, and a second version that added persistence mechanisms was released later. The third variant, 'Aquabotv3,' introduced a system that detects termination signals and sends the info to the command-and-control (C2) server. Akamai comments that Aquabotv3's mechanism to report back kill attempts is unusual for botnets and may have been added to give its operators better monitoring. CVE-2024-41710 is a command injection flaw impacting Mitel 6800 Series, 6900 Series, and 6900w Series SIP Phones, typically used in corporate offices, enterprises, government agencies, hospitals, educational institutes, hotels, and financial institutions. It is a medium-severity flaw that allows an authenticated attacker with admin privileges to conduct an argument injection attack due to insufficient parameter sanitization during the boot process, resulting in arbitrary command execution. Mitel released fixes and asecurity advisoryabout this flaw on July 17, 2024, urging users to upgrade. Two weeks later, security researcher Kyle Burns published a proof-of-concept (PoC)on GitHub. Aquabotv3's use of this PoC to exploit CVE-2024-41710 in attacks is the first documented case of leveraging this vulnerability. ""Akamai SIRT detected exploit attempts targeting this vulnerability through our global network of honeypots in early January 2025 using a payload almost identical to the PoC,""explains the researchers. The fact that the attacks require authentication indicates that the malware botnet uses brute-forcing to gain initial access. The attackers craft an HTTP POST request targeting the vulnerable endpoint 8021xsupport.html, responsible for 802.1x authentication settings in Mitel SIP phones. The application improperly processes user input, allowing malformed data to be inserted into the phone's local configuration (/nvdata/etc/local.cfg). Via the injection of line-ending characters (%dt → %0d), attackers achieve manipulation of how the configuration file is parsed during device boot to execute a remote shell script (bin.sh) from their server. This script downloads and installs an Aquabot payload for the defined architecture (x86, ARM, MIPS, etc), sets its execution permissions using 'chmod 777,' and then cleans up any traces. Once persistence is ensured, Aquabotv3 connects to its C2 via TCP to receive instructions, attack commands, updates, or additional payloads. Next, it attempts to spread to other IoT devices using the Mitel exploit, CVE-2018-17532 (TP-Link), CVE-2023-26801 (IoT firmware RCE), CVE-2022-31137 (Web App RCE), Linksys E-series RCE, Hadoop YARN, and CVE-2018-10562 / CVE-2018-10561 (Dasan router bugs). The malware also attempts to brute force default or weak SSH/Telnet credentials to spread to poorly secured devices on the same network.

CVE-2024-40891,2025-01-29,bleeping computer,"Hackers are exploiting a critical command injection vulnerability in Zyxel CPE Series devices that is currently tracked as CVE-2024-40891 and remains unpatched since last July. The vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary commands using the ‘supervisor’ or ‘zyuser’ service accounts. Vulnerability intelligence companyVulnCheck added the security issueto its database last year on July 12 and listed it among other issues exploited in the wild for initial access. Technical details on the vulnerability have not been publicly disclosed and Zyxel did not release a security advisory or a patch for CVE-2024-40891, and the issue remains exploitable in the latest firmware.

CVE-2024-57726,2025-01-28,bleeping computer,"Hackers are believed to be exploiting recently fixed SimpleHelp Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) software vulnerabilities to gain initial access to target networks. The flaws, tracked as CVE-2024-57726, CVE-2024-57727, and CVE-2024-57728, allow threat actors to download and upload files on devices and escalate privileges to administrative levels. The vulnerabilities were discovered anddisclosed by Horizon3researchers two weeks ago. SimpleHelp released fixes between January 8 and 13 in product versions 5.5.8, 5.4.10, and 5.3.9. Arctic Wolf now reports about an ongoing campaign targeting SimpleHelp servers that started roughly a week after Horizon3's public disclosure of the flaws. The security company isn't 100% certain that the attacks leverage these flaws but connects its observations to Horizon3's report with medium confidence. ""While it is not confirmed that the recently disclosed vulnerabilities are responsible for the observed campaign, Arctic Wolf strongly recommends upgrading to the latest available fixed versions of the SimpleHelp server software where possible,""reads the report. ""In situations where the SimpleHelp client was previously installed on devices for third-party support sessions but isn't actively being used for day-to-day operations, Arctic Wolf recommends uninstalling the software to reduce the potential attack surface."" Threat monitoring platform Shadowserver Foundation reported they see 580 vulnerable instances exposed online, most (345) located in the United States.  Artic Wolf reports that the SimpleHelp 'Remote Access.exe' process was already running in the background before the attack, indicating that SimpleHelp was previously installed for remote support sessions on the devices. The first sign of compromise was the SimpleHelp client on the target device communicating with an unapproved SimpleHelp server. This is possible by either the attacker exploiting flaws in SimpleHelp to gain control of the client or using stolen credentials to hijack the connection. Once inside, the attackers ran cmd.exe commands like 'net' and 'nltest' to gather intelligence about the system, including a list of user accounts, groups, shared resources, and domain controllers, and test Active Directory's connectivity. These are common steps before performing privilege escalation and lateral movement. However, Arctic Wolf says the malicious session was cut off before it could be determined what the threat actor would do next. SimpleHelp users are recommended to upgrade to the latest version that addresses the CVE-2024-57726, CVE-2024-57727, and CVE-2024-57728 flaws. More information about how to apply the security updates and verify the patch is available inSimpleHelp's bulletin.

CVE-2023-2868,2025-01-23,bleeping computer,"A malicious campaign has been specifically targeting Juniper edge devices, many acting as VPN gateways, with malware dubbed J-magic that starts a reverse shell only if it detects a “magic packet” in the network traffic. The J-magic attacks appear to target organizations in the semiconductor, energy, manufacturing (marine, solar panels, heavy machinery), and IT sectors. The J-magic malware is a custom variant of the publicly available cd00r backdoor - a proof-of-concept that stays silent and passively monitors network traffic for a specific packet before opening a communication channel with the attacker. According to researchers at Black Lotus Labs, Lumen’s threat research and operations arm, the J-magic campaign was active between mid-2023 and at least mid-2024 and was orchestrated for “low-detection and long-term access.” Based on the telemetry available, the researchers say that about half of the targeted devices seemed configured as a virtual private network gateway for their organization. Similarly to cd00r, J-magic watches the TCP traffic for a packet with specific characteristics - “magic packet” - sent by the attacker. It does this by creating an eBPF filter on the interface and port specified as a command line argument when executed. Black Lotus Labs researchers say the malware checks various fields and offsets for clues indicating the right packet from a remote IP address. J-magic looks for five conditions and if a packet meets one of them, it spawns a reverse shell. However, the sender must solve a challenge before getting access to the compromised device. The remote IP receives a random, five-character alphanumeric string encrypted with a hardcoded public RSA key. If the received response is not equal to the original string, the connection closes. “We suspect that the developer has added this RSA challenge to prevent other threat actors from spraying the internet with magic packets to enumerate victims and then simply repurposing, the J-Magic agents for their own purposes” - Black Lotus Labs Although the activity shares technical similarities with the SeaSpy malware, also based on the cd00r backdoor, some differences make it difficult to establish a connection between the two campaigns. The two malware look for five different magic conditions. Furthermore, the J-magic included a certificate that was used in the second verification process that provided shell access. The researchers say that based on these findings, they have “have low confidence in the correlation [of J-magic] to the SeaSpy family.” TheSeaSpy backdoorwas planted on Barracuda Email Security Gateways after  Chinese threat actors exploited CVE-2023-2868 as a zero-day vulnerability since at least October 2022. The threat actor behind SeaSpy, tracked internally by Mandiant as UNC4841,breached email serversof U.S. government agencies. Black Lotus Labs researchers believe that the J-magic campaign focusing on Juniper routers shows that the use of this type of malware is increasingly turning into a trend. By targeting enterprise-grade routers with “magic packet” malware, threat actors can stay undetected for longer periods as such devices are rarely power cycled, the malware resides in memory, and these devices typically lack host-based monitoring tools.

CVE-2024-32444,2025-01-22,bleeping computer,"The RealHome theme and the Easy Real Estate plugins for WordPress are vulnerable to two critical severity flaws that allow unauthenticated users to gain administrative privileges. Although the two flaws were discovered in September 2024 byPatchstack, and multiple attempts were made to contact the vendor (InspiryThemes), the researchers say they have not received a response. Also, Patchstack says the vendor released three versions since September, but no security fixes to address the critical issues were introduced. Hence, the issues remain unfixed and exploitable. The RealHome theme and Easy Real Estate are among the most popular themes and plugins designed for use in real estate websites. According to Envanto Market data, the RealHome theme is used in 32,600 websites. The first flaw, which impacts RealHome theme, is an unauthenticated privilege escalation problem tracked as CVE-2024-32444 (CVSS score: 9.8). The theme allows users to register new accounts via the inspiry_ajax_register function, however, it does not properly check authorization or implement a nonce validation. If registration is enabled on the website, attackers can arbitrarily specify their role as ""Administrator"" in a specially crafted HTTP request to the registration function, essentially bypassing security checks. Once registered as an administrator, the attacker can subsequently gain full control of the WordPress site, including performing content manipulation, planting scripts, and accessing user or other sensitive data. The flaw impacting the Easy Real Estate plugin is another unauthenticated privilege escalation issue via the social login. It's tracked under CVE-2024-32555 (CVSS score: 9.8). The problem stems from the social login feature, which allows users to log in using their email address without verifying if it belongs to the person making the request. As a result, if an attacker knows an admin's email address, they can log in without needing a password. The repercussions of successful exploitation are similar to those of CVE-2024-32444. As no patch has been released yet by InspiryThemes, website owners and administrators using the said theme or plugin should disable them immediately. Restricting user registration on affected websites would also prevent unauthorized account creations, limiting the potential for exploitation.

CVE-2024-12365,2025-01-16,bleeping computer,"A severe flaw in the W3 Total Cache plugin installed on more than one million WordPress sites could give attackers access to various information, including metadata on cloud-based apps. The W3 Total Cache plugin uses multiple caching techniques to optimize a website's speed, reduce load times, and generally improve its SEO ranking. The flaw is tracked asCVE-2024-12365despite the developer releasing a fix in the latest version of the product, hundreds of thousands of websites have still to install the patched variant. Wordfencenotesthat the security issue is due to a missing capability check in the ‘is_w3tc_admin_page’ function in all versions up to the latest one, 2.8.2. This fault allows access to the plugin's security nonce value and perform unauthorized actions. Exploiting the vulnerability is possible if the attacker is authenticated and has at least subscriber-level, a condition that is easily met. The main risks that arise from the exploitation of CVE-2024-12365 are: Regarding the real-world impact of this flaw, attackers could use the website’s infrastructure to proxy requests to other services and use the collected information to stage further attacks. The best action for impacted users is to take is to upgrade to the latest version of W3 Total Cache version, 2.8.2, which addresses the vulnerability. Download statistics fromwordpress.orgindicate that roughly 150,000 websites installed the plugin after the developer released the most recent update, leaving hundreds of thousands of WordPress sites still vulnerable. As a general recommendations, website owners should avoid installing too many plugins and discard the products that are not absolutely necessary.

CVE-2024-7344,2025-01-16,bleeping computer,"A new UEFI Secure Boot bypass vulnerability tracked asCVE-2024-7344that affects a Microsoft-signed application could be exploited to deploy bootkits even if Secure Boot protection is active. The vulnerable UEFI application is present in multiple real-time system recovery tools from several third-party software developers. Bootkits represent a critical security threat that is difficult to detect because they take action before the operating system loads, and survive OS re-installs. The issue stems from the application using a custom PE loader, which allows loading any UEFI binary, even if they are not signed. Specifically, the vulnerable UEFI application does not rely on trusted services like 'LoadImage' and 'StartImage' that validate binaries against a trust database (db) and a revocation database (dbx). In this context, 'reloader.efi' manually decrypts and loads into memory binaries from 'cloak.dat', which contains a rudimentary encrypted XOR PE image. This unsafe process could be exploited by an attacker by replacing the app's default OS bootloader on the EFI partition with a vulnerable 'reloader.efi' and planting a malicious 'cloak.dat' file on its nominal paths. Upon system boot, the custom loader will decrypt and execute the malicious binary without Secure Boot validation. The vulnerability affects UEFI applications designed to assist in system recovery, disk maintenance, or backups and are not general-purpose UEFI applications. ESET'sreportlists the following products and versions as vulnerable: It should be noted that attackers could exploit CVE-2024-7344 even if the above applications are not present on the target computer. The hackers could perform the attack by deploying only the vulnerable 'reloader. efi' binary from those apps. However, those using the above apps and impacted versions should move to the newer releases as soon as possible to eliminate the attack surface. ESET published a video to demonstrate how the vulnerability could be exploited on a system that has Secure Boot enabled Microsoft has released a patch for CVE-2024-7344 ESET discovered the vulnerability on July 8, 2024, andreported itto the CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC) for coordinated disclosure to the impacted parties. Affected vendors fixed the issue in their products and Microsoftrevoked the certificateson January 14th Patch Tuesday update In the following months, ESET worked with the affected vendors to evaluate the proposed patches and eliminate the security problem. Eventually, on January 14, 2025, Microsoftrevoked the certificatesof vulnerable UEFI applications, which should block any attempts to execute their binaries.

CVE-2018-13379,2025-01-15,bleeping computer,"A new hacking group has leaked the configuration files, IP addresses, and VPN credentials for over 15,000 FortiGate devices for free on the dark web, exposing a great deal of sensitive technical information to other cybercriminals. The data was leaked by the ""Belsen Group,"" a new hacking group first appearing on social media and cybercrime forums this month. To promote themselves, the Belsen Group has created a Tor website where they released the FortiGate data dump for free to be used by other threat actors. ""At the beginning of the year, and as a positive start for us, and in order to solidify the name of our group in your memory, we are proud to announce our first official operation: Will be published of sensitive data from over 15,000 targets worldwide (both governmental and private sectors) that have been hacked and their data extracted,"" reads a hacking forum post. The FortiGate leak consists of a 1.6 GB archive containing folders ordered by country. Each folder contains further subfolders for each FortiGate's IP address in that country. According to cybersecurity expert Kevin Beaumont, each IP address has a configuration.conf (Fortigate config dump) and a vpn-passwords.txt file, with some of the passwords in plain text. The configs also contain sensitive information, such as private keys and firewall rules. In ablog postabout the FortiGate leak, Beaumont says that the leak is believed to be linked to a 2022 zero-day tracked as CVE-2022–40684 that was exploited in attacks before a fix was released. ""I've done incident response on one device at a victim org, and exploitation was indeed via CVE-2022–40684 based on artefacts on the device. I've also been able to verify the usernames and password seen in the dump matches the details on the device,"" explains Beaumont. ""The data appears to have been assembled in October 2022, as a zero day vuln. For some reason, the data dump of config has been released today, just over 2 years later."" In 2022, Fortinet warned that threat actors were exploiting azero-day tracked as CVE-2022–40684to download config files from targeted FortiGate devices and then add a malicious super_admin account called 'fortigate-tech-support'. German news site Heise analyzed the data leak and also said that it was gathered in 2022, with all devices utilizing FortiOS firmware 7.0.0-7.0.6 or 7.2.0-7.2.2. ""All devices were equipped with FortiOS 7.0.0-7.0.6 or 7.2.0-7.2.2, most with version 7.2.0. We did not find any FortiOS version in the data trove that was newer than version 7.2.2, released on October 3, 2022,""Heise reported. However, FortiOS 7.2.2 fixed the CVE-2022–40684 flaw, so it would be unclear how devices running that version could be exploited with this vulnerability. Even though these configuration files were collected in 2022, Beaumont warns that they still expose a lot of sensitive information about a network's defenses. This includes firewall rules and credentials that, if not changed at the time, should be changed immediately now that the data has been released to a broader pool of threat actors. Beaumont says that he plans to release a list of the IP addresses in the leak so FortiGate admins can know if the leak impacted them. In 2021, a threat actorleaked almost 500,000 Fortinet VPN credentialsthat were collected using the CVE-2018-13379 vulnerability.

CVE-2024-12084,2025-01-15,bleeping computer,"Over 660,000 exposed Rsync servers are potentially vulnerable to six new vulnerabilities, including a critical-severity heap-buffer overflow flaw that allows remote code execution on servers. Rsync is an open-source file synchronization and data transferring tool valued for its ability to perform incremental transfers, reducing data transfer times and bandwidth usage. It supports local file systems transfers, remote transfers over secure protocols like SSH, and direct file syncing via its own daemon. The tool is utilized extensively by backup systems like Rclone, DeltaCopy, ChronoSync, public file distribution repositories, and cloud and server management operations. The Rsync flaws were discovered by Google Cloud and independent security researchers and can be combined to create powerful exploitation chains that lead to remote system compromise. ""In the most severe CVE, an attacker only requires anonymous read access to a rsync server, such as a public mirror, to execute arbitrary code on the machine the server is running on,"" reads thebulletin published on Openwall. The six flaws are summarized below: The CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC) issued a bulletin warning about the Rsync flaws, marking Red Hat, Arch, Gentoo,UbuntuNixOS, AlmaLinux OS Foundation, and the Triton Data Center as impacted. However, many more potentially impacted projects and vendors have not responded yet. ""When combined, the first two vulnerabilities (heap buffer overflow and information leak) allow a client to execute arbitrary code on a device that has an Rsync server running,"" warnedCERT/CC. ""The client requires only anonymous read-access to the server, such as public mirrors. Additionally, attackers can take control of a malicious server and read/write arbitrary files of any connected client. Sensitive data, such as SSH keys, can be extracted, and malicious code can be executed by overwriting files such as ~/.bashrc or ~/.popt."" In its own bulletin about CVE-2024-12084,RedHat notedthat there are no practical mitigations, and the flaw is exploitable in Rsync's default configuration. ""Keep in mind that rsync's default rsyncd configuration allows anonymous file syncing, which is at risk of this vulnerability,"" explains RedHat. ""Otherwise, an attacker will need valid credentials for servers which require authentication."" All users are advised to upgrade toupgrade to version 3.4.0as soon as possible. A Shodan search conducted by BleepingComputer shows that there are over 660,000 IP addresses with exposed Rsync servers. Most IP addresses are located in China, with 521,000 exposed, followed by the United States, Hong Kong, Korea, and Germany in much smaller numbers. Of these exposed Rsync servers, 306,517 are running on the default TCP port 873 and 21,239 are listening on port 8873, commonly used for Rsync over SSH tunneling. Binary Edge also shows a large number of exposed Rsync servers, but their numbers are lower, at 424,087. While there are many exposed servers, it is unclear if they are vulnerable to the newly disclosed vulnerabilities as the attackers would need valid credentials or the server must be configured for anonymous connections, which we did not test. All Rsync users are strongly advised to upgrade to version 3.4.0 or configure the daemon to require credentials.

CVE-2024-38058,2025-01-15,bleeping computer,"​Microsoft is investigating a bug triggering security alerts on systems with a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) processor after enabling BitLocker. BitLocker is a Windows security feature that encrypts storage drives to prevent data theft or exposure. According toRedmond, it ""provides maximum protection"" when used with a TPM ""to ensure that a device hasn't been tampered with while the system is offline."" ​TPMs are dedicated security processors that provide hardware-based security functions and act as trusted hardware components for storing sensitive data, such as encryption keys and various other security credentials. In anadvisorypublished Tuesday, the company says this known issue also affects unmanaged devices, known as BYOD (short for bring-your-own-device). These are usually personally owned devices used in enterprise environments that can be onboarded or secured using measures provided by each organization's IT or security team. On affected Windows 10 and 11 PCs, users will see a ""For your security, some settings are managed by your administrator"" alert ""in the BitLocker control panel and some other places in Windows."" Microsoft says it's currently working on a fix and will provide more details about the issue when it has more information. In April 2024, Microsoft fixed another issuethat triggered incorrect BitLocker drive encryption errorsin some managed Windows environments. The company tagged this issue in October 2023 asa reporting problemthat did not impact drive encryption. Months later, in August, Redmond addressed another bug causing some Windows devicesto boot into BitLocker recoveryafter installing the Windows security updates. The same month, itdisabled a fixfor a BitLocker security feature bypass vulnerability (CVE-2024-38058) due to firmware incompatibility issues that caused patched Windows devices to enter BitLocker recovery mode. Microsoft announced in June 2021 that TPM 2.0 is amandatory requirementfor installing or upgrading to Windows 11, saying it would make systems more resistant to tampering and sophisticated cyberattacks. However, this hasn't stopped Windows users from creating various tools, scripts, and techniquesto bypass it. More than three years later, in December 2024, Redmond made it abundantly clear that TPM 2.0 support isa ""non-negotiable"" requirement, as customers won't be able to upgrade to Windows 11 without it. Statcounter Global data currently shows that over 62% of all Windows systems worldwidestill run Windows 10, while less than 34% run Windows 11 three years after itsOctober 2021 launch. Based on an analysis of 14M malicious actions, discover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.

CVE-2025-21334,2025-01-14,bleeping computer,"Today is Microsoft's January 2025 Patch Tuesday, which includes security updates for 159 flaws, including eight zero-day vulnerabilities, with three actively exploited in attacks. This Patch Tuesday also fixes twelve ""Critical"" vulnerabilities, including information disclosure, privileges elevation, and remote code execution flaws. The number of bugs in each vulnerability category is listed below: To learn more about the non-security updates released today, you can review our dedicated articles on theWindows 11 KB5050009 & KB5050021 cumulative updatesand the Windows 10 KB5048652 cumulative update. This month's Patch Tuesday fixes three actively exploited and five publicly exposed zero-day vulnerabilities. Microsoft classifies a zero-day flaw as one that is publicly disclosed or actively exploited while no official fix is available. The actively exploited zero-day vulnerability in today's updates are: CVE-2025-21333,CVE-2025-21334,CVE-2025-21335- Windows Hyper-V NT Kernel Integration VSP Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability Microsoft has fixed three elevation of privilege vulnerability in Windows Hyper-V that were exploited in attacks to gain SYSTEM privileges on Windows devices. No information has been released as to how these flaws were exploited in attacks, and they all show that they were disclosed anonymously. As the CVEs for these three vulnerabilities are sequential and for the same feature, they were all likely found used or discovered through the same attacks. The publicly disclosed zero-days are: CVE-2025-21275- Windows App Package Installer Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability Microsoft fixed an elevation of privileges flaw in the Windows App Package Installer that could lead to SYSTEM privileges. ""An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain SYSTEM privileges,"" explains Microsoft's advisory. The vulnerability was submitted anonymously to Microsoft. CVE-2025-21308- Windows Themes Spoofing Vulnerability Microsoft fixed a Windows Theme vulnerability that could be exploited simply by displaying a specially crafted Theme file in Windows Explorer. ""An attacker would have to convince the user to load a malicious file onto a vulnerable system, typically by way of an enticement in an Email or Instant Messenger message, and then convince the user to manipulate the specially crafted file, but not necessarily click or open the malicious file.,"" explains Microsoft's advisory. The flaw was discovered by Blaz Satler with 0patch by ACROS Security, which is a bypass of a previous flaw tracked asCVE-2024-38030. 0patch previouslyreleased micropatches for this flawin October, while waiting for Microsoft to fix it. When a Theme file is viewed in Windows Explorer and utilizes BrandImage and Wallpaper options that specify a network file path, Windows automatically sends authentication requests to the remote host, including the logged-in user's NTLM credentials. These NTLM hashes can then be cracked to get the plain-text password or used inpass-the-hash attacks. Microsoft says the flaw is mitigated if NTLM is disabled or the ""Restrict NTLM: Outgoing NTLM traffic to remote servers"" policy is enabled. CVE-2025-21186,CVE-2025-21366,CVE-2025-21395- Microsoft Access Remote Code Execution Vulnerability Microsoft fixed three remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft Access that are exploited when opening specially crafted Microsoft Access documents.

CVE-2023-37936,2025-01-14,bleeping computer,"Attackers are exploiting a new authentication bypass zero-day vulnerability in FortiOS and FortiProxy to hijack Fortinet firewalls and breach enterprise networks. This security flaw (tracked asCVE-2024-55591) impacts FortiOS 7.0.0 through 7.0.16, FortiProxy 7.0.0 through 7.0.19, and FortiProxy 7.2.0 through 7.2.12. Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to gain super-admin privileges by making malicious requests to the Node.js websocket module. Fortinet says attackers exploiting the zero-day in the wild are creating randomly generated admin or local users on compromised devices and are adding them to existing SSL VPN user groups or to new ones they also add. They've also been observed adding or changing firewall policies and other settings and logging in to SSLVPN using previously created rogue accounts ""to get a tunnel to the internal network."" While the company didn't provide additional information on the campaign, cybersecurity company Arctic Wolfreleased a report on Fridaywith matching indicators of compromise (IOCs), which says that Fortinet FortiGate firewalls with Internet-exposed management interfaces have been under attack since mid-November. ""The campaign involved unauthorized administrative logins on management interfaces of firewalls, creation of new accounts, SSL VPN authentication through those accounts, and various other configuration changes,"" Arctic Wolf Labs said. ""While the initial access vector is not definitively confirmed, a zero-day vulnerability is highly probable. Organizations should urgently disable firewall management access on public interfaces as soon as possible."" Fortinet also advised admins in today's advisory to disable the HTTP/HTTPS administrative interface or limit what IP addresses can reach the administrative interface via local-in policies as a workaround. Arctic Wolf also provided a timeline for this CVE-2024-55591 mass-exploitation campaign, saying that it includes four phases: ""While the initial access vector used in this campaign is not yet confirmed, Arctic Wolf Labs assesses with high confidence that mass exploitation of a zero-day vulnerability is likely given the compressed timeline across affected organizations as well as firmware versions affected,"" the cybersecurity firm added. ""Given subtle differences in tradecraft and infrastructure between intrusions, it is possible that multiple individuals or groups may have been involved in this campaign, but jsconsole usage was a common thread across the board."" Fortinet and Arctic Wolf shared almost identical IOCs, stating that you can examine logs for the following entries to determine if devices were targeted. After logging in through the vulnerability, the logs will show a random source IP and destination IP: After the threat actors create an admin user, a log will be generated with what appears to be a randomly generated user name and source IP address: The security companies also warned that the attackers commonly used the following IP addresses in attacks: Arctic Wolf says it notified Fortinet about the attacks on December 12, 2024, and received confirmation from FortiGuard Labs PSIRT on December 17, 2024, that this activity was known and was already under investigation.

As mandated by the Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01, afterbeing addedto CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog, U.S. federal agencies must secure their networks against ongoing attacks targeting the flaw within three weeks by February 3. On December 19, the U.S. cybersecurity agencyalso addeda critical command injection security bug (CVE-2024-12356) in the same BeyondTrust software products. BeyondTrust found both vulnerabilities whileinvestigating the breachof some of its Remote Support SaaS instances in early December. The attackers stole an API key, which they later used to reset passwords for local application accounts. While BeyondTrust's December disclosure didn't explicitly mention it, the threat actors likely leveraged the two flaws as zero days to hack into BeyondTrust systems to reach its customers. In early January, the Treasury Department disclosed thatits network was breachedby attackers who used a stolen Remote Support SaaS API key to compromise a BeyondTrust instance used by the agency. Since then, the attack has beenlinked to Chinese state-backed hackersknown as Silk Typhoon. This cyber-espionage group, known for reconnaissance and data theft attacks, became widely known after compromisingan estimated 68,500 serversin early 2021 usingMicrosoft Exchange Server ProxyLogon zero-days. The threat actorsspecifically targeted the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which administers trade and economic sanctions programs, andthe Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews foreign investments for national security risks.

CVE-2023-32369,2025-01-13,bleeping computer,"Apple recently addressed a macOS vulnerability that allows attackers to bypass System Integrity Protection (SIP) and install malicious kernel drivers by loading third-party kernel extensions. System Integrity Protection (SIP), or 'rootless,' is a macOS security feature that prevents malicious software from altering specific folders and files by limiting the root user account's powers in protected areas. SIP allows only Apple-signed processes or those with special entitlements, such as Apple software updates, to modify macOS-protected components. Disabling SIP normally requires a system restart and booting from macOS Recovery (the built-in recovery system), which requires physical access to a compromised machine device. The security flaw (tracked asCVE-2024-44243), which can only be exploited by local attackers with root privileges in low-complexity attacks requiring user interaction, was found in the Storage Kit daemon that handles disk state-keeping. Successful exploitation could allow attackers to bypass SIP root restrictions without physical access to install rootkits (kernel drivers), create persistent, ""undeletable"" malware, or circumvent Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC) security checks to access victims' data.

CVE-2024-50603,2025-01-13,bleeping computer,"Threat actors are exploiting a critical remote command execution vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2024-50603, in Aviatrix Controller instances to install backdoors and crypto miners. The Aviatrix Controller, part of the Aviatrix Cloud Networking Platform, enhances networking, security, and operational visibility for multi-cloud environments. It is used by enterprises, DevOps teams, network engineers, cloud architects, and managed service providers. Discovered byJakub Koreptaon October 17, 2024, CVE-2024-50603 is caused by inadequate use of input sanitization functions in some API actions, allowing attackers to inject malicious commands into system-level operations. This allows threat actors to use specially crafted API requests to achieve remote command execution without authentication. The flaw impacts all versions of Aviatrix Controller from 7.x through 7.2.4820. Users are recommended to upgrade to either 7.1.4191 or 7.2.4996, which addresses the CVE-2024-50603 risk. Wiz Research reports that a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit released on GitHub on January 8, 2025, has fueled the exploitation of CVE-2024-50603 in the wild. Hackers are leveraging the flaw to plant Sliver backdoors and perform unauthorized Monero cryptocurrency mining using XMRig (cryptojacking). Wiz says that although only a small percentage of cloud enterprise environments have Aviatrix Controller deployments, most of them constitute a risk for lateral network movement and privilege escalation. ""Based on our data, around 3% of cloud enterprise environments have Aviatrix Controller deployed,""explains Wiz. ""However, our data shows that in 65% of such environments, the virtual machine hosting Aviatrix Controller has a lateral movement path to administrative cloud control plane permissions."" Wiz notes that there is no evidence of the attackers performing lateral movement, but they believe the threat actors utilize CVE-2024-50603 to enumerate the host's cloud permissions and explore data exfiltration opportunities. Aviatrixrecommendsthat impacted users upgrade to Aviatrix Controller version 7.1.4191 or 7.2.4996, which includes fixes for the vulnerability. Additionally, it's noted that the patch must be re-applied if it was applied to a version prior to 7.1.4191 or 7.2.4996, if the Controller is later upgraded to a version prior to 7.1.4191 or 7.2.4996, or the Controller does not have an associated CoPilot running version 4.16.1 or higher. Impacted users must also ensure that the Controller does not expose port 443 to the internet and that they minimize attack surface by following the recommendedController IP access guidelines.

The company manages and operates over 11 million .uk, .co.uk, and .gov .uk domain names and other top-level domains, including .cymru and .wales. It also ran the U.K.'s Protective Domain Name Service (PDNS) on behalf of the country's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)until September 2024, protecting over 1,200 organizations and over 7 million end users. Nominet is still investigating the incident but has not found evidence of any backdoors deployed on its systems, as first report byISPreview. Since it detected suspicious activity on its network, the company has reported the attack to relevant authorities, including the NCSC, and restricted access to its systems via VPN connections. ""The entry point was through third-party VPN software supplied by Ivanti that enables our people to access systems remotely,"" Nominet says in a customer notice shared with BleepingComputer. ""However, we currently have no evidence of data breach or leakage. We already operate restricted access protocols and firewalls to protect our registry systems. Domain registration and management systems continue to operate as normal."" While the company didn't share more information on the VPN zero-day used in the attack, Ivanti said last week that hackers have been exploiting a critical Ivanti Connect Secure zero-day vulnerability (tracked as CVE-2025-0282) tobreach a limited number of customers' appliances. According to cybersecurity company Mandiant (part of Google Cloud), the attackers started leveraging this vulnerability in mid-December, using the custom Spawn malware toolkit (linked to a suspected China-linked espionage group tracked as UNC5337). They've alsodeployed new Dryhook and Phasejam malware(not currently associated with a threat group) on compromised VPN appliances. Macnica researcher Yutaka Sejiyama told BleepingComputer that over 3,600 ICS appliances were exposed online when Ivanti released a patch for the zero-day on Wednesday.

The campaign has been underway since 2019 and is still ongoing, while the Japanese investigators have observed distinct phases with differentiation of targets and attack methods. In all cases, the primary goal is to steal information on valuable and advanced Japanese technology and gather national security intelligence. MirrorFace, also known as ""Earth Kasha,"" was previouslyobserved by ESETconducting attacks on Japanese politicians before elections, using phishing emails to deploy a credential stealer dubbed 'MirrorStealer' and also the 'LODEINFO' backdoor.

After breaching the networks, the threat actors infect targeted computers with LODEINFO, ANEL, NOOPDOOR, and other malware families capable of data exfiltration and various backdoors for persistent long-term access. NPA identified three distinct campaigns conducted by the MirrorFace hackers: The NPA highlights two evasion methods MirrorFace uses to persist in networks for extended periods without raising any alarms. The first usesVisual Studio Code tunnels, which are set up by the ANEL malware on the compromised system. These tunnels are used to receive commands to execute on infected systems, which are usually PowerShell commands. Reportedly, MirrorFace has been using VSCode tunnels since at least June 2024. This is adocumented tacticpreviously attributed to other Chinese state-sponsored hackers like STORM-0866 and Sandman APT. The second evasion method, employed since June 2023, involves the useWindows Sandboxfeature to execute LOADEINFO within an isolated environment, bypassing antivirus detection. Windows Sandbox is a virtualized desktop environment that can safely execute commands and run programs isolated from the host operating system. However, the host operating system, including Microsoft Defender, does not monitor this environment. This allows the threat actors to run malware that communicates with remote command and control (C2) servers while maintaining local filesystem access to the host via shared folders. Based on the above, the NPA recommends that system administrators monitor for suspicious PowerShell logs, unauthorized communications with VSCode domains, and unusual sandbox activity. While it is not possible to log commands executed in Windows Sandbox, the NPA says you can configure Windows policies on the host to audit process creation to detect when the Windows Sandbox is launched and what configuration file was used.

CVE-2025-0282,2025-01-09,bleeping computer,"Hackers exploiting the critical Ivanti Connect Secure zero-day vulnerability disclosed yesterday installed on compromised VPN appliances new malware called ‘Dryhook’ and ‘Phasejam’ that is not currently associated with any threat group. The security issue, now tracked as CVE-2025-0282 is acritical stack-based buffer overflowflaw that impacts Ivanti Connect Secure 22.7R2.5 and older, Ivanti Policy Secure 22.7R1.2 and older, and Ivanti Neurons for ZTA gateways 22.7R2.3 and older. Although the flaw has a broad impact, the vendor specified that attacks were only observed against Connect Secure appliances while also noting that the number of affected customers is “limited.” According to cybersecurity company Mandiant (now part of Google Cloud), attackers started leveraging the vulnerability since mid-December and used the custom Spawn malware toolkit. The malicious framework is typically associated with a suspected China-linked espionage that the company tracks as UNC5337 and is likely part of a larger cluster tracked as UNC5221. However, the previously unknown ‘Dryhook’ and ‘Phasejam’ malware families found on some compromised appliances are not attributed to any threat group at this time. Mandiant'sreportinforms that the attacker sent HTTP requests to specific URLs to identify ICS appliance versions. To hide the origin, the threat actor passed the requests through VPS providers or Tor networks. Next, they exploited CVE-2025-0282 to gain initial access, disabled SELinux protections, modified iptables rules to prevent syslog forwarding, and remounted the drive as ‘read-write’ to allow malware deployment. The researchers say that the hackers launched the Phasejam dropper, which that deploys a web shell to compromised components such as ‘getComponent.cgi’ and ‘restAuth.cgi,’ while also overwriting system files to allow command execution. The hackers also modified the upgrade script ‘DSUpgrade.pm’ to block real upgrades and simulate a fake upgrade process, so the malware would persist on the system. The attackers also install ‘Spawn’ tools like Spawnmole (tunneler), Spawnsnail (SSH backdoor), and Spawnsloth (log tampering utility), which, unlike the Phasejam web shell, can persist across system upgrades. Both Spawn malware and the new threata tried to evade Ivanti's Integrity Checker Tool (ICT) by recalculating the SHA256 file hashes for the malicious files so they passed verification. “SPAWNANT is careful to circumvent the ICT by recalculating the SHA256 hash for any maliciously modified files. Once the appropriate modifications are complete, SPAWNANT generates a new RSA key pair to sign the modified manifest.” –Mandiant The hackers goal appears to be stealing databases in the appliance that typically contain sensitive information related to ""VPN sessions, session cookies, API keys, certificates, and credential material."" ""Mandiant has observed the threat actor archiving the database cache on a compromised appliance and staging the archived data in a directory served by the public-facing web server to enable exfiltration of the database,"" explain the researchers. Finally, the threat actors use a new piece of malware called Dryhook to capture usernames and passwords during standard authentication processes and store them in base64-encoded form for future retrieval. System administrators are recommended to perform a factory reset and upgrade to Ivanti Connect Secure 22.7.R2.5, even if internal and external ICT scans find no signs of malicious activity. Mandiant has also shared a list of indicators of compromise (IoCs) along with YARA rules to help detect suspicious activity associated with this campaign. According to Macnica researcherYutaka Sejiyama, there were over 3,600 ICS appliances exposed on the public web when Ivanti released a patch for the vulnerability.

CVE-2024-52875,2025-01-08,bleeping computer,"Hackers are trying to exploit CVE-2024-52875, a critical CRLF injection vulnerability that leads to 1-click remote code execution (RCE) attacks in GFI KerioControl firewall product. KerioControl is a network security solution designed for small and medium-sized businesses that combines firewall, VPN, bandwidth management, reporting and monitoring, traffic filtering, AV protection, and intrusion prevention. On December 16, 2024, security researcher Egidio Romano (EgiX) published adetailed writeupon CVE-2024-52875, demonstrating how a seemingly low-severity HTTP response splitting problem could escalate to 1-click RCE. The vulnerability, which impacts KerioControl versions 9.2.5 through 9.4.5, is due to improper sanitization of line feed (LF) characters in the 'dest' parameter, allowing HTTP header and response manipulation via injected payloads. Malicious JavaScript injected into responses is executed on the victim's browser, leading to the extraction of cookies or CSRF tokens. An attacker could use the CSRF token of an authenticated admin user to upload a malicious .IMG file containing a root-level shell script, leveraging the Kerio upgrade functionality, which opens a reverse shell for the attacker. Yesterday, threat scanning platformGreynoise detectedexploitation attempts targeting CVE-2024-52875 from four distinct IP addresses, possibly using the PoC exploit code presented by Romano. The activity is marked as ""malicious"" by the threat monitoring platform, indicating that the exploitation attempts are attributed to threat actors rather than researchers probing systems. Also yesterday,Censys reported23,862 internet-exposed GFI KerioControl instances, although it is unclear how many of them are vulnerable to CVE-2024-52875 is unknown. GFI Software on December 19, 2024, releasedversion 9.4.5 Patch 1for the KerioControl product, which addresses the vulnerability . Users are recommended to apply the fix as soon as possible. If patching is not possible at the moment, admins should limit access to KerioControl's web management interface to trusted IP addresses and disable public access to the '/admin' and '/noauth' pages via firewall rules. Monitoring for exploitation attempts targeting the 'dest' parameters and configuring shorter session expiration times are also effective mitigations.

CVE-2024-12856,2025-01-07,bleeping computer,"A relatively new Mirai-based botnet has been growing in sophistication and is now leveraging zero-day exploits for security flaws in industrial routers and smart home devices. Exploitation of previously unknown vulnerabilities started in November 2024, according to Chainxin X Lab researchers who monitored the botnet's development and attacks. One of the security issues is CVE-2024-12856, a vulnerability in Four-Faith industrial routers thatVulnCheck discoveredin late December but noticed efforts to exploit it around December 20. to leverage zero-day exploits has been leveraging a zero-day exploit for CVE-2024-12856, impacting Four-Faith routers, alongside other custom exploits for flaws in Neterbit routers and Vimar smart home devices. The botnet, whose name is a homophobic reference, also relies on custom exploits for unknown vulnerabilities in Neterbit routers and Vimar smart home devices. It was discovered last year in February and currently counts 15,000 daily active bot nodes, mostly in China, the United States, Russia, Turkey, and Iran. Its main goal appears to be carrying out distributed denial of service (DDoS) on specified targets for profit, targeting hundreds of entities daily, with the activity peaking in October and November 2024. The malware leverages a mix of public and private exploits for more than 20 vulnerabilities to spread to internet-exposed devices, targeting DVRs, industrial and home routers, and smart home devices. Specifically, it targets the following: The botnet features a brute-forcing module for weak, Telnet passwords, uses custom UPX packing with unique signatures, and implements Mirai-based command structures for updating clients, scanning networks, and conducting DDoS attacks. X Lab reports that the botnet’s DDoS attacks are short in duration, lasting between 10 and 30 seconds, but high in intensity, exceeding 100 Gbps in traffic, which can cause disruptions even for robust infrastructures. “The targets of attacks are all over the world and distributed in various industries,”explains X Lab. “The main targets of attacks are distributed in China, the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Singapore,” the researchers say. Overall, the botnet demonstrates a unique capability to maintain high infection rates across diverse device types using exploits for n-day and even zero-day flaws. Users can protect their devices by following the general recommendation to install the latest device updates from the vendor, disable remote access if not needed, and change the default admin account credentials.

CVE-2023-1966,2025-01-07,bleeping computer,"BIOS/UEFI vulnerabilities in the iSeq 100 DNA sequencer from U.S. biotechnology company Illumina could let attackers disable devices used for detecting illnesses and developing vaccines. The Illumina iSeq 100 is advertised as a DNA sequencing system that medical and research labs can use to deliver “rapid and cost-effective genetic analysis.” Firmware security company Eclypsium analyzed the BIOS firmware in Illumina’s device and discovered that it booted without the standard write protections, leaving it open to overwrites that could “brick” the system or place implants for long-term persistence. The researchers found that iSeq 100 was running an outdated version of the BIOS firmware that ran in Compatibility Support Mode (CSM) to support older devices and was not protected through Secure Boot technology. Eclypsium’s analysis identified five major issues that allowed the exploitation of nine vulnerabilities with high and medium severity scores, one as old as 2017. Besides missing BIOS write protections, the iSeq 100 device was also vulnerable toLogoFAIL,Spectre 2, and Microarchitectural Data Sampling (MDS) attacks. Although booting in CSM mode permits legacy device support, it is not recommended for sensitive devices, especially if they are of a newer generation. The researchers found that the vulnerable BIOS (B480AM12 - 04/12/2018) on iSeq 100 did not have firmware protections enabled, which allowed modifying the code for booting the device. Combined with the lack of Secure Boot, which checks the validity and integrity of the boot code, any malicious change would remain undetected. In a report today,Eclypsium underlinesthat their analysis “analysis was limited specifically to the iSeq 100 sequencer device” and that similar issues may be present in other medical or industrial devices. The researchers explain that medical device manufacturers use outside suppliers for the computing power of the system. In the case of iSeq 100, the device relies on an OEM motherboard from IEI Integration Corp. Since IEI Integration Corp develops multiple industrial computer products and is anOriginal Design Manufacturer (ODM) for medical devices, Eclypsium says that “it would be highly likely that these or similar issues could be found either in other medical or industrial devices that use IEI motherboards.” The researchers also explain that an attacker that already compromised a device could leverage the vulnerabilities to modify the firmware to either brick the system. A threat actor with the necessary knowledge could also tamper with the test results. “If the data is manipulated by an implant/backdoor in these devices, then a threat actor may manipulate a wide range of outcomes including faking presence or absence of hereditary conditions, manipulating medical treatments or new vaccines, faking ancestry DNA research, etc.” -Eclypsium Eclypsium notified Illumina of the BIOS problems in iSeq 100 devices and the biotechnology company informed them that it issued a patch to affected customers. BleepingComputer reached out to Illumina for a comment on the delivery method for the fix and an estimation of the number of iSeq 100 systems that should receive it. A spokesperson for the company said that Illumina is following its “standard processes and will notify impacted customers if any mitigations are required.” “Our initial evaluation indicates these issues are not high-risk,” an Illumina representative told BleepingComputer. “Illumina is committed to the security of our products and to privacy of genomic data and we have established oversight and accountability processes, including security best practices for the development and deployment of our products. “As part of this commitment, we are always working to improve how we deliver security updates for instruments in the field,” reads the rest of the statement. In their report, Eclypsium’s researchers warn that a threat actor that can overwrite the firmware on iSeq 100 could “easily disable the device.” Disrupting the business by taking out high-value systems is exactly what ransomware actors are after since their goal is to determine the victim to pay the ransom by making its recovery efforts as difficult as possible. Apart from financially motivated attackers, Eclypsium says that state actors could also find DNA sequencing systems appealing because they “are critical to detecting genetic illnesses, cancers, identifying drug-resistant bacteria, and for the production of vaccines.” In 2023, the Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the U.S. released anurgent advisoryabout two vulnerabilities in Illumina's Universal Copy Service (UCS) that is present in multiple products used by medical facilities and laboratories across the world.

Apart from financially motivated attackers, Eclypsium says that state actors could also find DNA sequencing systems appealing because they “are critical to detecting genetic illnesses, cancers, identifying drug-resistant bacteria, and for the production of vaccines.” In 2023, the Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the U.S. released anurgent advisoryabout two vulnerabilities in Illumina's Universal Copy Service (UCS) that is present in multiple products used by medical facilities and laboratories across the world. One of the issues (CVE-2023-1968) received the maximum severity score while the other (CVE-2023-1966) had a high severity rating.

CVE-2021-26855,2025-01-06,bleeping computer,"New variants of the Eagerbee malware framework are being deployed against government organizations and internet service providers (ISPs) in the Middle East. Previously, the malware was seen in attacks conducted by Chinese state-backed threat actors whoSophos trackedas 'Crimson Palace.' According to a new report by Kaspersky researchers, there's a potential connection to a threat group they call 'CoughingDown,' based on code similarities and IP address overlaps. ""Because of the consistent creation of services on the same day via the same webshell to execute the EAGERBEE backdoor and the CoughingDown Core Module, and the C2 domain overlap between the EAGERBEE backdoor and the CoughingDown Core Module, we assess with medium confidence that the EAGERBEE backdoor is related to the CoughingDown threat group"" explainsKaspersky Kaspersky couldn't determine the initial access vector in the Middle East attacks but reports that, in previous cases, two East Asian organizations were breached via the exploitation of the Microsoft Exchange ProxyLogon flaw (CVE-2021-26855). The attack involves the deployment of an injector (tsvipsrv.dll) dropped in the system32 directory to load the payload file (ntusers0.dat). Upon system start, Windows executes the injector, which then abuses the 'Themes' service, as well as SessionEnv, IKEEXT, and MSDTC, to write the backdoor payload in memory using DLL hijacking. The backdoor can be configured to execute at specific times, but Kaspersky says it was set to run 24/7 in the observed attacks. Eagerbee appears on the infected system as 'dllloader1x64.dll' and immediately begins collecting basic information like OS details and network addresses. Upon initialization, it establishes a TCP/SSL channel with the command-and-control (C2) server from where it can receive additional plugins that extend its functionality. The plugins are injected into memory by a plugin orchestrator (ssss.dll), which manages their execution. The five plugins documented by Kaspersky are the following: Overall, Eagerbee is a stealthy and persistent threat that has extensive capabilities on compromised systems. The same backdoor-loading chain wasalso discovered in Japan, so the attacks are global. Organizations should patch ProxyLogon on all Exchange servers and use the indicators of compromise listed in Kaspersky's report to catch the threat early.

CVE-2024-43405,2025-01-04,bleeping computer,"A now-fixed vulnerability in the open-source vulnerability scanner Nuclei could potentially allow attackers to bypass signature verification while sneaking malicious code into templates that execute on local systems. Nuclei is a popular open-source vulnerability scanner created by ProjectDiscovery that scans websites for vulnerabilities and other weaknesses. The project utilizes a template-based scanning system of over 10,000 YAML templates that scan websites for known vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, exposed configuration files, webshells, and backdoors. The YAML templates also include acode protocolthat can be used to execute commands or scripts locally on a device that extends the functionality of a template. Each template is ""signed"" with a digest hash that Nuclei uses to verify that the template has not been modified to include malicious code. This digest hash is added to the bottom of templates in the form of: A newNucleivulnerability tracked as CVE-2024-43405 was discovered byresearchers at Wizthat bypasses Nuclei's signature verification even if a template is modified to include malicious code. The flaw is caused by a Go regex-based signature verification and how the YAML parser handles line breaks when verifying the signature. When verifying a signature, Go's verification logic treats\ras part of the same line. However, the YAML parser interprets it as a line break. This mismatch allows attackers to inject malicious content that bypasses verification but is still executed when processed by the YAML parser. Another issue is how Nuclei handles multiple# digest:signature lines, as the process only checks the first occurrence of # digest: in a template, ignoring any additional ones found later in the template. This can be exploited by adding additional malicious ""# digest:"" payloads after the initial valid digest that contain a malicious ""code"" section, which is then injected and executed when the template is used. ""Armed with the insights about mismatched newline interpretations, we crafted a template that exploits the disparity between Go's regex implementation and the YAML parser,"" explains Wiz researcher Guy Goldenberg. ""By using \r as a line break, we can include a second # digest: line in the template that evades the signature verification process but gets parsed and executed by the YAML interpreter."" Wiz responsibly disclosed the flaw to ProjectDiscovery on August 14, 2024, and it was fixed in Nuclei v3.3.2 on September 4. If you are using older versions of Nuclei, it is strongly advised that you update the latest version now that the technical details for this bug have been publicly disclosed. Goldenberg also recommends that Nuclei be used in a virtual machine or isolated environment to prevent potential exploitation from malicious templates.
